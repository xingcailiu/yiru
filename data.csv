2019/08,5,Worth every minute,"Fine museum with something for everyone of every age! Wonderful paintings both contemporary and traditional, a huge carved buddah, a mummy and sarcophogus, Japanese swords, and too many more wonderful things to mention. Do not miss!",
2019/11,5,A hidden gem,"RISD Museum of Art was bigger than I expected. The Gorham exhibit was fascinating and informative. The ""Raid the Icebox 2"" exhibits were terrific. A re-do from 50 years ago when RISD invited Andy Warhol to raid the icebox (storage) and create an exhibit, this year RISD invited 10 current artists to do the same. So fun to see the unique ways to show the artwork.",
2019/11,4,Nice to visit on a rainy Sunday,"It is a very small museum, but the best parts are the Pendleton House and the Gorham Silverware exhibit.",
2019/11,5,A Quality Art Museum In Historic Providence,"Recently,I returned to Providence and the delighful RIsd Art Museum.I devoted my day to studying its quality European paintings and sculpture.I did not see everything in this art museum that has a broad range of Art.Old Master personal favorites were Spinello Aretino's""Saint Anthony Abbott Enthroned"",Jacopo di Cione's""Taking of Saint Peter"",Giusseppe Cesari's""Perseus and Andromeda"".Aert de Gelder's""Esther and Mordecai"",Francisco Collantes'""Hagar and Ishmael"".Marinus Van Reymerswaele's""Money Changers"",and Giovanni Pannini's""Colliseum"".19th Century favorites were Jean Victor Bertin's""Tivoli"",Edouard Manet's""Repose"",Claude Monet's""Bassin At Argentieul""(awesome French Impressionism),Carolus Duran's""Portrait of Manet"",and Edgard Degas'""La Savoissiene"".I also savored the fine Gothic and Renaissance Period sculptural works that were on display such as Ivory Diptych from 13th Century France depicting Nativity and Crucifixion,and Tillman Riemenschneider's ""Pieta"",among others..Kudos to a fine art museum in historic Providence.",
2019/11,5,,"We had 1 day in Providence. The RISD Museum was on our Must-Do list and it did not disappoint!

Varied types of exhibits for all to enjoy & the current Gorham collection. Our young children enjoyed the museum as well - they wanted to sit and sketch like a number of other museum guests on the 3rd floor by the Modern and Contemporary art.

We visited on a Thursday AM and paid for parking in a local lot. We did our homework regarding visitors fees, lockers, personal bag size requirements. Musuem was easy to navigate. We enjoyed the Cafe Pearl for a coffee and snack. Very friendly staff all throughout the museum. We are glad we visited - RISD Museum was on our bucket list.",
2019/11,4,"Eclectic collection, something for everyone","RISD Museum is fairly small so can be tackled easily in a couple of hours. It houses a very eclectic collection, from ancient Egyptian mummies to the most avant garde works of today. Enjoyable and fairly admirable museum, especially for a less than huge city.",couple

2019/10,5,surprising and rich also with for kids,"interesting collections and beautiful spaces, we spent a couple of hours and did not manages to tour the entire museum. The variety is such that also a 10y old can find something to enjoy!",
2018/11,5,An Amazing Destination for Art Lovers,"As a RISD alum, I'm naturally biased, but the Museum of Art at the Rhode Island School of Design is an amazing destination for a day trip in southern New England. Paintings, prints, sculpture that runs the gamut of artistic syles can be found right here in Providence, Rhode Island. Why not check it out?!",
2019/09,5,Eclectic Things to Enjoy,"RISD offers art, theater and music - from modern and classical. I've enjoyed everything from modern dance, ethnic music, famous antique silverware, movies, student and professional artworks, etc. Everything has been high quality, free and open to the public.",
2019/09,5,Wow! Must See!,"I was blown away by the RISD. Great contemporary art from the Classics -Picasso, Rodin sculptor, Chihuly (alum) to the wonderful and insightful student art work. So much to see!",Friends
2019/09,4,Excellent collection,"An excellent collection well worth the visit. Spread out on six floors, starting on the third floor in a staggered way... the docents were very helpful in finding your way. The museum is seemingly constructed in different buildings and as you move through the space, it's a bit of a wayfinding 3D puzzle. Maps were very helpful. And the collections, especially in the impressionism was, very impressive. The special exhibit of Gorham Silver was very nicely curated -- thank you.",
2019/09,4,Interesting collection,The museum is a sprawling collection of interconnected buildings including the reproduction of the Pendleton House. The Gorham silver exhibit was especially interesting.,couple
2019/09,5,Very Fine and diverse collection,"We came to see the Gotham Silver show , which was great, and stayed for the great furniture, paintings, decorative art and fashion. Definitely worth the trip. ",couple
2019/09,5,Not to be missed in Providence,"This museum is a small gem associated with the Rhode ISLAND SCHOOL OF DESIGN and located near Brown University. It has an excellent eclectic collection of fine arts, glassware, pottery, clothing, impressionist paintings and modern arts, textiles, graphic arts, etc. Exhibits are well presented with good lighting and visible explanations. Special exhibits are offered regularly. There is a gift shop and a small cafe. The current Gorham silver exhibition is of special interest in Rhode Island as the company was founded here. Part of the exhibit is a workbench with videos showing the evolution,design and production of selected silver items. Guards are friendly and helpful. The museum is free to the public on Sundays, otherwise there is a $15.00 admission fee with student , child and senior discounts. Do not miss!",

2019/07,5,Fascinating Collection: A Must See When in Providence,The Gorham exhibit currently on display at the RISD Museum is superb. Beautifully presented and described.

2019/07,5,Worth a trip,"This is an amazing small museum. The works include some of the most famous artists. All of the works are first rate.

2019/07,5,A Hidden Gem with an Outstanding Collection of Various Types of Art,"My husband and I visited the RISD Museum in Providence, Rhode Island on Sunday, July 14, 2019. This is an excellent museum with all galleries well laid-out and nicely curated with an outstanding collection of various types of art. All the write-ups throughout the museum were quite educational and interesting addressing cultural, historical, political, social and religious aspects of the art, depending upon what was applicable. The special exhibit on Gorham Silver was exquisite and definitely worth seeing. This museum is definitely a hidden gem!! Our visit to the museum took about two hours, based on the amount of time available to us, but it could easily have taken well over 3 hours to be able to absorb and appreciate all the artwork on display. We definitely needed a map to get around the museum because of the way all the galleries are connected throughout multiple floors and buildings. The only real drawback to this museum is parking. Fortunately, we were able to find a space on Benefit Street, a convenient walk to the museum. However, finding a space may not have been easy if school was in session. We really liked the 18th and 19th Century American exhibits, especially related to the Pendleton House rooms. These included the rooms with the titles: ‘The China Trade Room’, ‘The Well-Furnished Farmhouse in Providence’, ‘Two Generations of Rhode Island Cabinetmakers’, ‘Cabinetmaking in Newport’, ‘Gambling Collectors - Tea Pots’, and ‘The Charles Pendleton’s Library’. All the furnishings in these rooms were very impressive. Even the curtains were beautiful. Touring these rooms was like a walk back through time. The Ancient Greek and Roman exhibits were nicely arranged with many objects, such as, bronze, metals, Roman Jewelry and coffins, coins, sculptures, Greek Funerary, figures from different cultures and vases, vessels and flasks for the Greek Gods and Goddesses and much more. All the objects displayed in these galleries were well preserved. The European Art featured very impressive paintings by many masters under multiple classifications such as ‘Painting Modern Life’ with Impressionists using new techniques in their brushstrokes, ‘Painting Landscapes’ with a heightened regard for nature and ‘Abstracting Modern Life’. All these paintings were beautiful. There was Religious Art from the 1300s with emphasis on Material and Meaning. Also in the 1300s there was an ‘Unearthing of the Past’ where the ancient pasts of Greece and Rome were rediscovered by European artists and there was a cultural, movement called Humanism during the Renaissance era, encouraging curiosity about nature, the world and individual expression, which was very interesting. In addition, the artwork within this gallery addressed ‘Trade Across Cultures’, ‘Venice and the Marketplace’, and ‘Imperialism and Production (1686 – 1851)’ where there was an exchange of techniques and materials. There was also a section/gallery on the different aspects of the ‘Artist’s Profession’ as it related to European art in the early 1800s. The Art of Ancient Egypt – from 5,000 years ago emphasized the funerary traditions with a rather impressive mummy on display. The art was for a functional or ritual purpose and words and pictures were combined to convey a unique meaning as depicted in the ‘Understanding of Egyptian Objects’ display, which addressed the interesting principle of mixed perspective among other aspects of this art. The Asian Art included very nice Japanese emerald and clay, devotional and funerary objects, including Budha and a gallery representing insects with ‘A chorus of Chirps, Hums and Buzz’. The Costume and Textile and Quilt Galleries were impressive as well as the Modern and Contemporary art, including very elegant and unique clothing and furniture.The Print Making – Visions and Revisions was quite educational with displays regarding ‘Aquatint and Goya’, ‘Etching and Rembrandt’, and Mezzotint Engraving. The write-ups for these displays addressed the processes involved with these techniques in art and were definitely quite educational. Special Exhibit: ‘’Gorham Silver – Designing Brilliance 1850 – 1970’: This exhibit addressed the many aspects of Gorham Silver and illuminates the heights of Gorham’s industry, ambition, artistry, technology, creativity and innovation. The history of the founding of Gorham was addressed with its beginnings in a small workshop to its significant growth as depicted in the display ‘Gorham Silver and American Industrialization’. Through machinery and equipment, the company had sufficient size and power to handle silver as though it was putty. with something for everything. The Classical Design and Source Materials were addressed as well as the Gorham Workbench which displayed the processes and tools used to create Gorham silver. ‘Design Inspirations and Influences’ were depicted with the ‘Restless Laboratory’ where the silver went from a Classical to Japanese Design with the American Aesthetic Movement and the desire to fulfill social aspirations. ‘Creating Gorham Silver’ illustrated the most perfect system with an effective network of organizational practices and a well-managed inventive approach. The ‘World of Styles in Providence’ were also on display. This was a very impressive and well done exhibit with many pieces of exquisite silver on display within it, definitely worth seeing. We recommend a visit to this museum and hope that you have the opportunity to enjoy it as much as we did. It has a real lot to offer, much more than what I mention here!!.",
2019/07,3,Gorham silver exhibit,Interesting history and craftsman detail of Gorham silver. Display was nice but not overly impressive. If you have visited stately homes ( Europe ) you may find it lacking. $15.00 for 2 rooms?,
2019/05,5,A Little Gem!,"RISD is a little gem of a museum. Holding a general collection, in less than an hour you can get a very satisfying aesthetic experience. And in two hours you can get an excellent, quick survey of art history. What makes a visit so perfect is the careful curation, thoughtful installations and intelligent labels. I chose to spend time in the special exhibition of Gorham silver and the Contemporary and European of 18/19th century floors. For me, the silver was a revelation. I had no idea Gorham made such pieces of upscale elegance and ambition. Founded in Providence, Gorham became the largest silver company in the world. And RISD has fabulous holdings. The high-end pieces showcased in this exhibition would have made any Newport dinner party guest envious. Elsewhere I found an excellent example of making a meaningful teaching point with limited objects in a display case of medieval/early renaissance art that combined carved ivory, portraits and illuminated manuscripts. But if I could only go back to see one piece--the one I would run out with in case of fire—it would be Manet’s portrait of the American artist Berthe Morisot titled “Repose.” It’s what the Michelin guide would call “worth a journey.” Visiting tips: The museum is housed on several levels of two buildings, which can be a little confusing for a first visit. So be sure to get a map and don’t hesitate to ask the staff for directions. The collections are open until 9:00 pm on third Thursdays. Tickets are $12 for seniors, $15 for adults. The gift shop is worth a glance and the garden well worth a stopping point.",Solo
2019/07,5,Delightful,Had a wonderful time here. A great variety of works. The Gorham silver-smithing exhibit was a great surprise. Very much enjoyed the impressionist rooms with Monets and Cezannes.,couple
2019/07,4,RSDI,"Fantastic! Nice ""sampler"" of art from the ancients to modern, with a design oriented twist. Rodin's hand of god was my personal favorite",
2019/06,5,Gorham Silver Display,Enjoyed the special showing and stories of Gorham Silver. Enjoyed seeing clothes by Coco Channel. Staff very helpful and kind.,Friends
2019/06,5,A wonderful collection,"If you are in Providence this is a must see. IT is an eclectic collection but worth the trip, works of are are well explained and staff great.",Solo
2019/06,5,Wow!,"If art is your thing, this place is amazing. There is a lot of Egyptian, Asian, and European art. It is spectacular. We spent several hours here and still didn’t see everything.",
2019/05,5,"Small on size, big on offerings: RISD!","Adult family spent a day in Providence, including a visit to the ""M-word"" (museum). We arrived after a late lunch and were literally the last ones to leave, such was our penchant for loitering amongst beautiful, historical items fabricated for love and money. We loved it!",Friends
2019/06,4,Nice little museum,"Although a museum of design, it covers quite a range within that remit. When I was there, they had a special silver exhibition which included some interesting pieces, especially a rather witty ice bowl and a cubist tea set. The main collection features some major artists such as Rodin, Picasso, Pollock, Monet, Van Gogh and Renoir. There are also works by less well known artists and lots of pieces from ancient times.",Solo
2019/05,4,"Not What I Expected, but Very Nice","As an artist myself, I've heard *so much* about RISD and its museum. I was expecting to see more contemporary, abstract paintings, but that's not really what you'll find here. Instead we saw a huge, super cool Buddha - loved it. We also enjoyed the Gorham exhibition (well, I did, not sure about my husband). My favorite part was probably the floor with the Van Goghs. Normally you have to fight and push your way to get up close with a VVG, but we had the space all to ourselves - quite nice :) It's a small museum with a little bit of everything. You can easily cover it in 1-2 hours.",
2019/05,4,"Not What I Expected, but Very Nice","From Egyptian mummies to paintings and sculptures by Old Masters to American furniture to a top silver collection to textiles, this museum has something for every interest and is worth visiting. Small in size compared to the large museums, the RISD Museum is sophisticated and offers enough for multiple visits.",Friends
2019/06,4,If you have time visit!,"The museum was great and the exhibits were a very good cross section of art and other displays. It was very well organized and the stuff were very helpful as they enforce the security of the museum. The good news, there was no charge to the museum on that Sunday afternoon.",Friends
2019/05,4,Gorham exhibition is a must,"After a private lecture on the exhibit we spent about an hour marveling at the craftsmanship of the silver on exhibit and the history of the brand. The museum is clean, well lit, very accessible and a must visit.",couple
2019/06,5,Wonderful contemporary design displays,"The RISD museum contains a carefully curated wide-ranging display of historic and contemporary arts and design exhibits. I particularly enjoyed the contemporary displays by predominantly local artists and RISD graduates. The European, Asian and Egyptian displays are small but well done. The historical American parlour displays are well worth seeing too, arranged as they are to reproduce historical dwelling interiors.",Solo
2019/05,5,Great experience,"Must see collections, which include great European impressionists, Picasso, Van Gohg. Free admission on Sundays.",
2019/05,5,Memorial Weekend Optional,about RISD Museum and the visit lived up to every expectation. Both interesting and entertaining- my husband loved it and so did my 17 year old son. A great family outing! Highly recommended.,Family
2019/05,5,A real Gem,"We've been to museums all over the world. This one has a little of everything that can work with your pace. The building is well designed and the staff (including security guards) are extremely courteous, kind and knowledgeable. We were lucky to be here on the first Sunday of the month so we got in for free. We checked out the entire museum in 2.5 hours. The RISD M of Art is located conveniently in downtown area, and you can access it by walking if you are staying in the area. The students are so lucky to have this collection of works to be learn and develop their understanding of art related works and also of cultures. I wish I had this when I attended college. Hope you enjoy it as well.",Couple 
2019/05,5,Don’t miss,RISD Museum is worthy of a visit. Very nice exhibits on several floors. Interesting gift shop. Thursday evenings are free!,couple
2019/05,4,Nice ... very small. Budget an hour.,The museum is very fun and very small. We had no idea what the exhibit was - turned out to be Gorham silver - 1850-1970. It was interesting. We enjoyed a lot of the interactive student work on the second floor. This was a perfect for us to spend an hour while waiting for our car to charge. Don’t forget to exit through the gift shop.,
2019/05,5,Go! Go! Go!,"Pick an artist of note, and RISD will have them. Pick a period or a type of medium, it's here. Great masters, modern art, marble frome rome, textiles, weapons, tea pots, a whole revolutionary period house, 20 foot tall wooden buda, mummy....getting the picture?
Cafe, gift shop, on street free parking, fully handicap accessible, it will take a minimum of an hour if you fly through, 2ish is normally how long it takes.",Family 
2019/05,5,Gorham exhibit,When my wife said she’d like to see the exhibit on Gorham silver I was a little dubious. But it was really interesting to see the fantastic work done by this RI institution. Little hard to get to given the building renovation but worth the effort,couple
2019/05,5,Amazing collection,"Absolute treasure of a museum with fabulous examples of Barbizon landscapes, Impressionism, and decorative arts and design. The current exhibition on Gorham silver is an absolute must see.",business
2019/04,5,World class museum,I visited on a Sunday afternoon (free admission) and was impressed with their diverse collection of art from ancient Egyptian artefacts to contemporary works of art from all over the globe. I ran out of time to see as much (as thoroughly) as I would have liked. Thanks would definitely go back; it’s such an incredible resource for a fairly small city but a true jewel !,Solo
2019/03,5,Amazing quality of art for size of museum,"We were lucky enough to arrive in Providence on the third Thursday evening of the month...when the RSID museum is free. So, without a concrete plan for the evening, we decided to puruse the museum before we went to dinner. Wow! What a wonderful museum. The museum is packed with treasures ranging from Byzantine art to Impressionists to British print works. We were only drawn away by the rumbling of our stomachs. The museum is very well curated and well worth a visit...especially if you are lucky enough to be there for a free Thursday night.",Family
2019/01,5,"Beautiful museum, they even have a mummy.",This is a treasure of a museum. You can find pretty much every style of artform within. The staff is Friends and you can easily take it all in within a couple of hours. You will leave feeling quite cultured and full of joy from all the beauty you've taken in.,Friends
2019/03,5,Surprisingly Great,"To be honest I went in with low expectations since we have some of the best art museums in the world in NYC. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the museum and the collection. My students and I enjoyed the ancient artifacts. The number of world renowned painters they had on display was amazing. We didn’t know there was an old house attached which was fantastic. The student stuff we barely looked at. They even had a wheelchair for one of my students free of charge. We needed about 1.5 hours to see it all. I would definitely go back.",Business
2019/03,5,Ancient Greek and Roman Room is my Happy Place,My partner and I decided to take a few days to stay in Rhode Island. One of the things we wanted to make sure we caught was this museum. The Bona Drag temporary exhibit and the Greek and Roman room were on the top of my list and they didn't disappoint. I would recommend this to anyone,couple
2019/03,5,Pleasant afternoon,"Easy access, pleasant atmosphere, many students also in the gallery which added to the joy of visiting the museum.",
2019/03,4,most enjoyable,"Following a delightful Saturday lunch nearby, our daughter, her husband (both RISD alums) and their two children, ages 6 and 9mos. toured the museum for a couple of hours. Our grandson was hoping for some dinosaur fossils but was not unhappy about there being none, and enjoyed viewing the statuary and many works of art. We were somewhat disappointed that the contemporary art gallery floor was being renovated and not available for visiting, but not unhappy about all that we were able to view and appreciate. All in all, it was most enjoyable for all.",Family
2019/03,4,"A bit light on design, but a much broader collection than expected","We were expecting a museum focused on design, but saw that in fact, the design displays in this museum are only a small fraction of the collection. There is an antique home that has been incorporated into the museum, and there are Asian, Greek and Egyptian components, among others. The collection was much larger and more diverse than we expected!",couple
2019/03,4,More than we expected,Our visit was totally worthwhile. The museum and collection were much bigger than we expected. Very nice. Definitely glad we took the time to do this.,couple
2019/02,4,Much better than anticipated,"I knew I wanted to tour the RISD Museum but did not know much about it's collection. Extremely surprised by the Impressionists and some of the other unexpected pieces. I've seen Chihuly glass at the V&A in London and the MFA in Boston, and was thrilled to learn more about this artist (had no idea he taught at RISD!) Very glad we went. Tip: entrance is free on Sundays.",couple
2019/12,4,A large variety of experiences,"The museum has a wide variety of artifacts from ancient Egypt and the Mediterranean through current day. The modern art section, 20th century, is a focus of course, but the museum has large presence of Impressionists - very rewarding.",couple
2019/11,5,Something for everyone,"The RISD museum has something for everyone. Special visiting exhibits, classical, modern, European, Asian and more. I never tire of repeat visits. Check it out on Sundays for FREE! I brought my 8 year old niece this past summer and she was hooked. Left the museum and drove to buy art materials straight away...now that’s inspiration!",Solo
2019/02,5,Best Universty Art Museum I've Ever Seen,"The RISD Museum has a surprisingly large, varied, and high-quality collection -- everything from painting and sculpture to textiles and furniture, dating from 3000 BCE to yesterday. The exhibits are very professionally staged and curated, but the hodge-podge building makes it all feel charmingly cozy and quirky. It's a world-class museum at Rhode Island scale. I could live here for weeks, if they'd let me!",Friends
2019/02,5,Fascinating Building and Use of Space,"Museum covers most of a block between North Main and Benefit Streets, on the side of the hill. Exhibits integrated across diverse cultures, so that you can get a sense for comparison. Second floor has student exhibits, which were intriguing and definitely worth exploring.",Family

2019/02,5,Impressive Collection!,This is a lovely museum with an impressive collection of all kinds of art. I loved the Impressionist paintings and the Asian art collection. A very worthwhile visit!,Friends
2019/02,5,Amazing collection of art,"This museum is a gem and should be a destination for any one interested in art. The collection is extensive and the well displayed. The museum is just large enough to provide an very nice visit for a morning or an afternoon. On the first floor there is a collection of student art which was fascinating. One of the things that makes this museum so interested is the amalgamation of several buildings on the hill side. They are very skillfully linked together to make a very interesting architectural unit. There is a small cafe, lockers available and some audio guide programs too. Parking can be a bit of an issue but we finally found a space not too far from the museum. Staff is very friendly and knowledge. A must see.",Family
2018/12,5,"Friends go here,also has a great museum","ranked one of the finest art/design schools in the world what can you say. Great instructors who are into the arts themselves in a big way. some world know in their own right. well maintained buildings in walking distance to downtown Providence,RI. it has the best of all worlds. near Brown University. Has some of its own stores and shops. Students from all over the world come here and you have to have a lot of talent to get into this school. a lot.
If you have talent in the arts,contact them and I am sure they will send you the info you need. Have a good friend who is an assistant to one of the school officers.",Family
2019/01,4,Nice collection,A nice sampling of art throughout different eras; the museum's collection has grown over time. Would appreciate seeing more in the way of design innovations.,couple
2019/01,5,Groovy Museum with Respectable Collection,"“My girlfriend and I have had this place on our list for a while. We went on a Sunday because it's FREE on Sundays which is great. My one complaint about that was there were lots of kids with their families - some sort of community arts function - so it was a bit on the loud and crowded side. But I'm all for community functions of that sort so it was a small price to pay for free admission.

The museum is more extensive than its appearance from outside would indicate. Each floor has a different focus - modern art, European painting from a number of different centuries (the Impressionist pieces may have been my favorite), and a whole floor of antiquities from Rome, Japan, Egypt, and other places around the world, including an impressive wooden Buddha sculpture (the largest in the West, if I remember correctly).

The museum can be done quickly in less than two hours, but for the most thorough experience I would recommend at least three, so you can read up on some of the different pieces. Even despite the crowds we found the museum to be charming and tasteful, certainly an impressive collection. I would recommend this spot to anyone appreciative of fine art in all its forms.”

2018/12,5,Great Museum,"This is a great museum - and far too big to visit properly in one day. Fabulous modern European masters (think quality not quantity) - representing Cassatt, Monet, Pissaro, Van Gogh, Picasso and more. Good collection from the middle ages and an acbsolutely stupendous collection of colonial era furniture well displayed in a house (colonial repro) built for the purpose over 100 years ago.",couple
2018/11,5,Great tour of a lot of different periods and a great kids program,"We did a free (with admission) art hour program for kids with my 8 year old and it was awesome. It was interesting, informative, and engaging. Great way to introduce kids to art. The museum was also great. It has what I would almost call a sampling from many different periods/places. I'm not an art guy but I think it would be even more appealing for people like me- you get to see so many different kinds of impressive art in a brief period of time. It's compact but didn't feel small. It also felt very swank and an interesting location and place. Great excuse to get by the Brown/RISD neighborhood too and see that as well. Highly recommend for almost anyone.",Family
2018/08,5,Lovely small museum,"Sure, it's not as grand or enormous as the Met or Louvre but, nevertheless, absolutely worth visiting.

2018/11,3,Need st least 3 hours here.,"The exhibit that was on was very liberal& contemporary, not my taste.
The other floors were interesting & historical.",
2018/07,5,Great museum,"RISD Museum is an eclectic yet expansive selection of art from colonial America through the current era. A half day would be useful to be able to see the whole collection but that would be at a very fast pace. The museum is spread across multiple buildings and multiple floors, each section clearly marked and noted. This is the number 1 attraction in Providence for a reason - it is that good. There is a small cafe located on the ground floor of one of the buildings and plenty of restrooms throughout.",couple
2018/11,5,Great visit with Friends,"“We went to the museum on a Friday. We obtained passes from our local library. But, the cost for the museum is small and worth it. Parking is available in lots near the museum. You receive a 50% discount for parking. Just get the ticket validated at the entrance to the museum. The museum is on several floors in two buildings. The staff are friendly and helpful in describing the exhibits. The museum has everything to see from modern art, furniture, students work to the old masters. It is a collection of private art and the art of the students in the design school. A place to store coats, bags and several clean restrooms. A nice cafe to purchase food and enjoy a hot or cold drink. Sereval nice restaurants near the museum. There is alos a river walk to enjoy on a nice day. Right in downtown Providence, just off the highway.”

2019/06,4,Lovely small museum,"Interesting museum that is small but not as small as it first appears, and has a range of different collections. Although I have never had to pay for admission I would be happy to shell out $10 or so.",Solo
2018/10,3,Free on Sundays,"The museum is free on Sundays. Not sure I would have considered it worth the money had we had to pay, to be honest. It has a nice collection of design pieces, but the curation is somewhere between awful and haphazard. The layout of the exhibits is confusing. We spent less than two hours.",couple
2018/10,5,definitely worth a visit,"A lovely museum with a large and eclectic collection, including clothing, furniture, jewelry, paintings and sculpture -- spanning the ancient Greeks to today.

2018/07,5,Interesting,"We only had about 1/2 a day to visit this museum. I really liked the Rockefeller Asian Art collection and the Charles Pendleton House. All the exhibits were interesting. Those were my favorite. We ended up spending more time than we expected. It's right by the Atheneum, so we ran by there when we were finished.",Friends
2018/08,5,An amazing collection,"Stopped by the museum while in Providence for business and more than pleasantly surprised. Not only do they have an extensive collection that has artists that the general population will recognize, but the space is beautiful. The many gallery spaces are varied and each has its own feel. From the skylights in the European wing to the Pendleton house. Every corner you turn is a new adventure!",Solo

Note that parking is not easy to find - expect to drive around a bit as many street parking spots are by permit only. The museum itself was quite lovely and diverse - exhibits ranging from modern art, ancient artifacts and architectural pieces, history, and fashion/textiles. In order to see the whole thing, I think 2 hours would be ideal. The gift shop was okay, just a bit overpriced. Staff at the museum were all incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. Admission is typically $15/adult, but on Sundays it is free :)",couple

Impressionist painters to Ancient Greek artifacts, Buddha statues to English pottery.... something for everyone.
Our 12 year old son also enjoyed this museum as there was so much choice to see.",
2018/08,4,A Rewarding Diversion in the Heart of Providence,"As most other reviewers have indicated, this small museum is a real revelation. Although it is not the most well-laid out art museum I have ever visited, the modest-sized galleries are jam-packed with an astonishingly eclectic collection, from works of ancient Babylon and Egypt to pieces by Helen Frankenthaler and Mark Rothko. The small collection of Impressionist painters might not rival larger museums like Boston's MFA, but the works they feature by Monet, Renoir, Cezanne, and others are sure to satisfy any aficionado. The attached galleries of the Charles Pendleton House feature a number of reconstructed rooms of 19th century furnishings, decorative pieces, and art, including paintings by John Singleton Copley. As a couple of others have indicated, the political commentary accompanying several of the contemporary pieces can be alienating and ham-handed, and it might be better to let the art speak for itself, but that is par for the course in the current climate. I discovered much the same thing visiting the National Portrait Gallery. The plainness and ill-lighting of some of the galleries aside, I would happily recommend RISD's Museum of Art to anyone visiting the Providence area or even nearby Boston. I visited on a Friday afternoon, and found the museum to be only sparsely to modestly attended, allowing pleasantly intimate encounters with the enormous 12th century Buddha Mahavairocana and the 12th century Spanish Crucified Christ.",Solo
2018/08,5,"Very Fine Collection, Well Displayed",The RISD Museum has a very fine collection that spans old masters to impressionists to modern art to and impressive collection of early American furniture and art.

2018/08,5,Great little museum,"The RISD museum is a great little museum. It is small, but has a nice overview of art from ancient Egypt and Rome to very contemporary pieces. I was surprised with their Impressionists (Van Gogh, Manet, Degas, Monet). They also have rooms with Colonial furniture and decorations. Just be aware: their guide is not a map and it can be very confusing making your way through the museum. However, there are very helpful security people throughout.",couple

It's like a Mini Met with coverage of so many diverse geographic areas and time periods and styles. I could go on and on, but I think that pretty much says it. Just do it, and you will not be disappointed.

This museum is actually housed in a collection of neighboring buildings connected by interior walkways. Plan to spend at least half a day, and a full day if you're a serious fan of fine arts and crafts for the past 4000 years, and everything in between.",Family

2018/07,2,Caucasian Males Beware,"My wife and I have been to numerous museums in the United States and Europe but never have we encountered such hostility toward caucasians, particularly males, as we did at this museum. In addition, most of the art seemed sophomoric to us and not particularly good. I will say that the people who work in this museum were friendly and helpful, but we would never consider returning due to the hostility exhibited by the paintings that were everywhere in this museum.",couple
2018/07,5,Free Admission on Sunday,"I hadn't done as much planning as I had hoped to for our time in Providence, so I was happily surprised that admission on Sunday is free as was our street parking.

2018/07,5,"Wonderful, Broad Collection","RISD’s art museums popped up in a couple of “best of” lists for college/university art museums and I can see why. It’s a fairly big collection that covers a lot of ground - from ancient Egypt to religious iconography, colonial art, Impressionism, modern art, and even student work is on display. We really enjoyed our visit. Also, as members of our local art museum, which participates in the North American Reciprocal Museum membership program, meaning we get free admission to those fellow museums which includes this one, we have saved a ton of money on our vacation this week. I highly recommend getting one if you frequent museums and gardens.",Family
2018/07,4,Large facility and large variety,"I was surprised at how large this museum was (there are a number of connecting buildings). There was a lot of variety among the exhibits, and I especially enjoyed the balloon sculptures (I'm guessing from a summer camp) on the fence outside. I visited using my NARM reciprocal membership, which was a great deal.",Solo

2018/06,4,Great Museum Associated with The Best Design School,"The building You will find everything from ancient art to textiles. Of course, the buddha is cool. The museum's contemporary collection houses some of the Greats including Picasso, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Bruce Nauman who happens to live in Santa Fe, just like their alum and phenomenal painter, Grant Hayunga. The Chace Center is the main entrance. You may want to double-check, but I believe the museum is closed on Monday and opens at 10am the rest of the week. The highest admission rate is for adults at $15. There is a store inside for your RISD swag. Certainly a well rounded collection without omitting any form of art. Enjoy the garden if the weather is nice.",Friends

We had taken a red-eye from the West Coast to Boston the previous night and so didn't want anything too strenuous. We all enjoy museums and found out that admission to the RISD museum is free on Sundays! And it is located next to Brown University, whose campus our 16-year old son wanted to see.

The museum has a small but impressive collection of Asian artifacts (including a Japanese palanquin and huge Buddha statue), contemporary art, fashion and furniture (think Frank Lloyd Wright, Alvar Aalto, Diane von Furstenberg, Pollock, and Calder), Egyptian artifacts (including a sarcophagus and mummy), an impressive textile collection, and other European and American art. We greatly enjoyed wandering around to see and read about everything.

There is also a nice coffee shop by the north entrance with indoor and outdoor seating, and a gift shop featuring works by former RISD students by the south entrance. And did I mention that admission is free on Sundays?!! A must see if you're in town on the seventh (or first) day of the week, only a 5 or 10 minute walk from the train station!",Family
2017/10,5,A must see!,"Tucked away right by the river on College Hill, I had passed by so many times without even knowing it was there. Its amazing how a rather large museum can fit in such a small area. The staff are very friendly and the art itself is mesmerizing. Highly recommend it.",Friends

Those with a keen interest in art and historical artifacts will find it fascinating. Don't forget to explore Pendleton House, which has an incredible collection of American decorative art set up within the context of a period home.

The museum is fairly compact across multiple floors organized by theme. Although we were given a map and there are signs, I found the complex floor plans a little bit difficult to navigate. All of the staff were very friendly and approachable, and did their best to help us get around.

It is fully accessible, and although there is no parking on site, street parking is available nearby - we were there during the week, so parking was a bit limited, but we still managed to find a spot - not sure what it would be like on the weekend.",Couple 
2017/10,5,Amazing museum,"We were at the RISD Museum last October, and it ended up being one of the highlights of our New England tour. It is large enough to have a wide range of exhibits, and yet it is not overwhelming. The exhibits were well laid-out and the information about different pieces was excellent. As an amateur furniture maker (very amateur) I was thrilled to see examples of cabinetmaking by guys like Goddard and Townshend, whose pieces name command millions at auction.",couple
2018/06,3,Interesting museum with a bit of everything,"The primary reason I didn't give it more stars was because the section we started in contained many negative sentiments. Rather than making me think about the message they were trying to convey, there was so much negativity that it just really brought me down. It was hard for me to shake it. Granted, this was how the artists were feeling, but there is enough positive in the world that some of it could have been included in the displays. I loved the Egyptian, Greek, and Asian displays. The European Galleries included paintings by Cézanne, Degas, Manet, Matisse, Monet, Morisot, Picasso, and Van Gogh, which I also enjoyed. Non-flash photography is allowed. The cost per adult was $15, which I thought was a bit steep.",Family

This museum has something for everyone and house much more than I expected. the Phantom of Liberty Contemporary Works exhibit included photos, prints and drawings that were very thought provoking. Do take the time to read the information next to the works because it is quite important for the understanding of the works. One must see this exhibit and form his/her own opinion of these incredible works. Beyond that, we also enjoyed the other permanent collections. There was an excellent historical American area with colonial rooms in beautiful furnishings. An ancient area had Greek, Egyptian and Roman works. In the European section we were surprised at the size of the Impressionist art. Costumes and Textiles were also well represented. This museum is truly worth seeing and you need to allow a good amount of time for exploring!”

Additionally, there is a collection of a wealthy Providence resident that is housed in a replica of his original home. The collection includes his artwork, furnishings and other collectibles.

Our only disappointment was the exhibit of student art. The museum is part of the RISD (Rhode Island School of Design). If the presentation of “art” that we we observed is representative of the future of these artists, the school should shut down.",couple
2018/05,5,Great museum,"This is a very interesting museum with much to see. It's a little difficult to figure out where you are at times but the security guards are extremely helpful with guidance.

2018/04,4,You get easily lost - but nice collection,"It is a quite big museum - and you can get easily lost, because I think the signage is quite strange, or maybe not enough maps. Also it is a bit disorganized and there is no real connection between the different galleries, mixing eras and geographic zones.
But I appreciated the fact there was not only paintings but also sculpture and antic objects. The quality was overall very good.

From the outside the museum doesn't look that big but it actually has 3.5 full floors dedicated to different works of art including a house which was built for the sole purpose of displaying furniture from the 1800s & 1900s. The museum features a little bit of everything including some new modern art with interesting concepts.

First off it was free on this particular Sunday.
They have a large, well curated collection. They even have a mummy!
We also attended a free concert given by a local group that teaches music to children in Providence. It was great, a really wonderful concert of various pieces for strings.
The building is very nice also.

2018/02,5,“Sunday’s no charge”,Since there was no charge on Sunday we decided to explore the RISD Museum. We were pleasantly surprised what a great museum this is. It’s sort of eclectic mix of new and old. The old section is like a house from the 1800’s filled with old paintings. We saw a Gilbert Stuart if George Washington along with many great furnishings of that period. We also saw a Renoir a Pollock along with student exhibits. It’s so large that after a couple of hours we agreed we’ll visit again. Such a great take with a nice cafe at the end. If you do visit parking even on Sunday can be a challenge.,couple
2018/02,4,Mirabile Dictu,"Both the variety and quality of artifacts on display a true the RISD museum of art make it a museum I wouldn’t like to visit on multiple occasions. The Asian collection, in particular, stands out for its Korean porcelains and Hindu imagery. Too, the Egyptian artifacts really sparkle with their superbly maintained colors and intricacy of hieroglyphs. Perhaps the standout items, though, are a massive wooden Buddha and a carved mantelpiece, both of which balanced delicacy and scale.",couple

2017/12,5,Neat special exhibit,The museum itself is wonderful. A hidden gem of Providence (see the wonderful Rotho). But current special exhibit which traces the various roles of drawing over the ages is also well worth seeing Since last July there is also a Bolt Coffee cafe with light food at the Benefit Street entrance- a nice place to relax,couple

2017/11,5,Rhode Island School of Design Museum of Art,"This is a must see and do place if visiting the Providence, RI area. We went there after reading the reviews and were not disappointed.

If you like art, then please spend a few hours and see all the paintings and art work that is displayed over the last few centuries. WOW !!!!!!!!",couple

2017/10,4,Impressive museum,"The museum is larger than we expected, and quite sprawling. We spent a good 3 hours wandering through the exhibits, which were varied--everything from furniture to impressionist painters, to ancient Greek urns to minimalist art.",couple
2016/10,4,Surprisingly lots of interesting exhibits,"We made it up the hill (several times thanks to metered parking time limits) to visit this lovely museum courtesy of the Bank of America monthly museums on us perk. Surprisingly one of my Friends was also able to snag a free ticket for her SO even though he did not have a BoA card. I was not expecting much from this museum in terms of size and variety since it's part of RISD campus, but there are countless interesting works of art. I even felt tired during a portion of walking around that I retreated to the seating area where they were playing some of their student film creations on the lower level.

I think one of our favorite pieces was the 3D painting which is basically created with several hundreds of layers stacked on top of each other and the chrome almost makes it look like a mountain of paper clips. They also have some ancient art work and coins in one of the other rooms which is always fascinating to read about.

One of the parts that I'm confused about was the parking since on the website it sounded like visitors are able to use the staff parking since they're obviously not working, but it wasn't really clearly labeled. We didn't want to risk a ticket so we just found a metered spot a few streets down slightly lower on the hill.",Friends
2017/10,5,Always Great,"It's been four years since my last visit and as always great to go back here. Should be a ""must"" on any visit to Providence. There are 6 levels, that include Modern & Contemporary, European, Egyptian, Decorative Arts & Design, 18th & 19th Century American. They also have a cafe offering drinks and delicious eats.",Friends
2017/10,5,Rich Museum Experience,"I think of a museum visit as the perfect pastime - culturally enriching, socially expansive, intellectually stimulating, and sensually engaging. The RISD Museum is one that I'd often heard of and never visited even though Providence is only an hour and a half drive from my home. I loved this wonderful small museum and reveled in the experience of discovering its fine collection.

The building is state-of-the-art with climate control, natural lighting in some of the galleries, and an entire China Trade House incorporated into the museum. The collection is rich, particularly in the area of decorative arts. There is lots of silver, porcelain, furniture, and sculpture, particularly in the Charles Pendleton House. The house itself is beautifully restored and serves as a showcase for a sumptuous collection of 18th and 19th century American furniture and decorative arts. Goddard, Townsend, Seymour, Phyfe, Allison, and dozens of other famed makers are represented.

There are also galleries dedicated to Greek, Roman, and Egyptian art - Nice. Painting galleries aren't as comprehensive, though lovely things are on exhibit - some French Impressionists, some Renaissance Italian art, some French Academic things, a very fine Lawrence portrait, a Tiepolo ceiling fresco, and very fine Asian arts. I thought the American painting collection outstanding.

Overall, I enjoyed myself and immersed myself in the collection. I particularly liked the juxtaposition of costume, porcelain, silver, painting, and other disciplines in the same galleries. Very enjoyable. I'd recommend a visit to this museum to anybody. Enjoy!",Friends
2017/10,5,Outstanding place to visit,"Excellent place to spend few hours enjoying art from different corners of the world and time periods. Beautiful collections. We especially enjoyed the staging of colonial period living quarters, truly takes you back in time. Plan for 3 hour visit if you want to see every exhibit and read through some of the works but you can make almost a day out of it if you wanted to. There is a coffee shop at the entrance with some light food. Parking outside is limited to 2 hours so you might want to look for some spot further away without time limit since 2 hours not nearly enough. Sundays are free to enter.",couple
2017/10,5,Just across the Providence River,"While Providence itself may seem small, RISD museum and the RSID community is rich full of art and theory (No surprise there). This museum and its location really showcases the talent and art making of RISD students, alumni, artists and makers. The museum houses Ancient Roman work to Joan Mitchell and David Hockney (Two of my favorite artists). It also is home to current student bodies of work. They do offer student discounts even to out of state students (valid ID must be shown) and you can photograph the work. The museum also has a Cafe in between floors with great music in the background along to with some coffee.",solo
2017/10,5,Not What I Expected...Better!,"We happened in on a ""free"" Sunday, but we would have paid, it is a wonderful museum! The breadth of variety in the collections surprised me. There truly is something for everyone. I saw people sketching the masters as well as modern art, and access to the historic home next door...brilliant! The gallery spaces within the house are wonderful as well. We arrived a little late in the day, but had a full two hours and it was JUST shy of enough time to really enjoy, we rushed at the end to not be shuttled out the door at closing!",
2017/02,5,Hidden Gem,"This small museum belonging to the Rhode Island School of Design is a fascinating place to spend an afternoon. From Master painters to mummys, there is something interesting around each corner.",Friends
2017/09,4,Great museum in an unlikely place!,"When you come to Providence you'll hear the name of two schools: RISD and Brown. Of course when you come visit one, you'll inevitably see the other as they are right next to each other (essentially the same campus!). Anyways, as you probably figured, they have an art museum of an eclectic array of different forms of art.

To be honest, I am not the most ""artsy"" person ever, but I try to appreciate the work and thought that is put into each piece. Unless you're a member of the museum, a Brown or RISD student, you'll have to pay a fee to come visit the museum.

The museum is HUGE and you can easily get lost. Even just walking through will take a couple of hours. There are several floors and don't forget to see the student display on the second floor. That was by far my favorite but not technically a part of the museum. I just wish they put more student art on display! On your way out on the first floor stop by the gift store and take a look at all the cool things they have for display. You don't have to buy (but it'll be difficult not to), but just come to window shop!!",Couple 
2017/09,5,Wow,"I was not expecting such a wide range of artistic talent to be displayed here. It has paintings from many eras, sculpture, modern design, and much more. I was impressed. It can compete with museums in NYC.",Business

2017/09,4,"Outstanding assortment, thoughtfully presented","This is not a museum, I told my family; this is a curriculum. That was a compliment. The range of art and especially the presentation are designed to educate and inspire. We enjoyed the eclectic assortment of art exploring the relationship of humans and nature and especially appreciated the chance to pull out drawers to look at the textile and costume displays. Not huge, not comprehensive, but not intimidating or overwhelming.",Friends
2017/09,5,A pleasurable visit,"Wonderful way to spend a few hours in Providence. Housed in five buildings, the museum galleries are fun to walk through for the architecture and interior design as well as to view the collection and exhibitions.

2017/08,5,A fabulous museum,"The RISD Museum of Art has an assortment of collections. There is a room with table china - pitcher collections and such. There are several portrait and painting galleries. There is a whole floor of fully furnished rooms, I believe from the Pendelton collection. There are several rooms of ancient Egyptian artifacts, , even a mummy. There is also a whole room of Budda's. They do have RISD student work on exhibit, as well. My recommendation is that you give yourself plenty of time, 2 to 3 hours, if you are the type who like to browse and linger.",Friends
2017/08,5,Wonderful Museum,"Really enjoyed this museum. There is a great variety of artwork and artifacts on display. Something for everyone. I also liked that they had an area that displayed the work of students. The girl working at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. This museum is much larger than I anticipated, so you should give yourself at least 2-3 hours to see the whole thing. Parking was a bit of a hassle. I had to park a few streets uphill from the museum. This is a must-see while you are in Providence.",couple
2017/09,4,Very enjoyable,"Impressive to see such a collection in a university. Names like Pollack, Rembrandt, Rodin, Toulouse Lautrec, Rothko to name but a few. The collection covers a wide range to suit most people's Interest. There is a food facility there as well.",couple

There's lots to see on various floors/levels so allow yourself ample time to explore and see everything. There was art from various world regions on display and also modern art presented by RISD students. If you're looking for a unique and artistic cultural attraction in Providence, Rhode Island then come visit the RISD Museum of Art. There's a gift shop on the bottom floor and elevators or stairs to get between levels/floors. There's a cafe on site as well. I found it easy to get lost in this place and so it was helpful that they had staff located at various points in the museum in order to ask how to get to certain areas. The ancient Greek and Egyptian art and artifacts was a highlight for me. The Asian art and artifacts were also very interesting.",Family
2017/08,4,Great Smaller Museum,"A wonderful art museum that you can spend a morning or afternoon in. The collection is diverse and there are some very unique pieces (the largest wooden Buddha sculpture in the US, for example).

2017/08,3,Worth the visit,"The museum is a little hard to navigate even with a map, but there are employees stationed throughout. Exhibits are in various rooms, some of which require moving from one level to another on the same floor. Consequently, it might be hard for someone in a wheelchair, though not impossible. There's a wide variety of incredible art with great descriptions. I learned a lot. For the average visitor, you could probably see everything in about 2 hours without rushing. Free locker use. Small cafe with coffee and a few pastries. The outdoor garden was a peaceful getaway with seating. If I lived here, I'd probably visit the museum often.",business
2017/08,3,Didn't quite meet the hype,"Before visiting Providence I was very interested in ""things to do,"" & the RISD museum was consistently near the top of the list. I enjoy spending a few hours in a museum, so I was excited to go. The collection is very diverse, and there are certainly some extraordinary pieces scattered throughout. But overall I was a little underwhelmed. Perhaps I'm too accustomed to the museums in bigger cities. It was a worthwhile visit, but hardly the highlight of my trip.",solo
2017/08,4,Interesting and Eclectic Collection,"There is quite a variety of art and artifacts on display, from Egyptian and Ancient Greek to contemporary.

Another exhibit compared student creations to Japanese and chinese robes. Definitely worth your time.,

2017/05,5,Better than Expected,"I was impressed by some of the biggest names in art history with wonderful works in this museum: Monet, Van Gogh, Kandinsky, Manet, Cezanne, Reynolds, Cole, Sargent. The collection is diverse and ""lively."" There are challenging pieces arranged in stimulating ways. There is a floor devoted to student work, and the objects were thought-provoking. The museum is connected to the Pendleton House and you can enjoy a kind of Mount Vernon experience as part of the visit. The RISD complex is between Brown University and downtown Providence, both minutes away by foot.",Solo
2017/05,5,World class art,"This museum is like a small version of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. There are rooms of Egyptian, Greek, Roman and Eastern art as well as room settings from various furniture periods. The painting collection is also impressive and there are special exhibitions, too. I highly recommend a visit here.",
2017/01,5,A nice place to visit,"I have been visiting this museum annually for about 50 yrs. The new site is welcoming, clean and great! Visit you'll enjoy it I'm sure",Friends
2016/08,4,Impressive,"Great museum! A surprisingly large collection of famous paintings. Quite interesting and user friendly, I enjoyed very much. However I would caution that it is not a place for children or even teens. Side note, it is free on Sundays which is a huge bonus",couple
2017/05,5,Incredible Gem in Providence,This museum has the most incredible collection of art. It compares to the best art museums in the world. It also has tours for tots on some Saturdays.,Friends
2017/05,4,Five Star if it wasn't being renovated ... small but packs a punch,"There were many famous paintings in the impressionistic section, very impressive collection in a small museum. It's very easy to tour and spent about 2 hours but, that was all due to the move and reconstruction of the museum with a few floors closed. In the one ""storage room"" nothing was labeled so you couldn't tell what you were looking at but, it was beautiful art. I would have like to see sections on student art but, it wasn't available if it's offered anywhere.",Family
2017/05,4,"Compact in size, expansive in collections","This is one of the better mid-size art museums one is likely to encounter. Not surprising, considering its association with one of the nation's most respected design schools. Even so, the breadth and depth of the collections is impressive, and not to be missed if you are visiting Providence",couple
2017/05,5,Amazing variety of art,"I was so blown away by the incredible amount of art in this little museum! I didn't expect there to be so many floors, and sections. I especially loved the Egyptian and Asian sections, as well as the section on Impressionism.

The fact that it's free on Sunday was an especially fantastic bonus! If you're planning a visit try to make it on a Sunday!",couple
2017/05,5,Wonderful collection and setting,"We had no idea what a remarkable museum this is - the architecture, the collections, the intimacy of the galleries, it all was a pleasant surprise. Definitely should be a ""must see"" when visiting Providence. And don't rush - plan to stay for a few hours.",couple
2017/05,5,A Jewel of a Museum,"Sunday is ""free"" day at the RISD Museum, so it was perhaps more crowded than on a pay day, but we never felt crowded. The Benefit Street entrance leads into an early-19th century house, with many rooms of antique furniture and accessories. The North Main Street side has more contemporary art, but also Ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman artifacts.",couple

2017/05,4,AMazeIng,"Took the advice of our fellow TA'S and with a raining weekend at hand explored the museum. The exhibits were well done and very interesting from glass to furniture to Impressionists to sculptures to mummies to Chuhuly to Greeks/Romans. The Cafe Pearl was small but the light lunches/snacks/beverages were delicious. Be aware they are under renovation and you must walk back and forth across the museum to get elevators to get to exhibits-- but amid the maze, it is well worth while.",Couple

2017/05,5,RI's best kept secret of an Art Museum.,So many wonderful exhibits and so many locations throughout the Museum. Perfect anytime. Outstanding collection for a small local Art Museum. Worth gold as far as I am concerned.,couple
2017/04,5,Incredible collection,What a surprise to find such masterpieces in a college museum. We visited during renovations but found a huge collection of works in a large room with a string quartet playing and artists painting and sketching. Beautiful example of a working museum.,couple
2017/05,5,good family activity,They often have family museum tours and art classes on the weekend. It is a great place for families with children from about age 4 and up. They also have wonderful exhibits in the museum for all ages.,

2017/04,3,"A museum you can cover in one day

","The interior of the museum was confusing and some of the exhibits were haphazardly displayed. The gift shop had the normal array of jewelry, books & art in difference mediums. Some of the RISD t-shirts were artful & funny.",Family
2017/02,5,Providence is a very walkable city and this museum should be on your path.,"This is a great stop while also touring other city attractions and has something for everyone. The museum's collection is eclectic covering time from ancient to modern. I was fascinated by multi-media creations by RISD students. How far we have come from pencil on sketch pad!
Two other favorites were Intermission display of European objects and paintings that included a sculpture of the Monument to Balzac by Auguste Rodin and glass chandelier by Chihuly. If you must arrive by car, there is validated parking within one block.
The museum was under construction/renovation during my visit so it was a little disorienting to move from floor to floor but staff are wonderfully helpful.",Solo
2017/04,5,Well Edited Collection,"This museum was a wonderful surprise. An impressive and well curated collection in which to spend an hour or so. Interesting gallery spaces, welcoming staff at the front desk, and a vibrant store adds to the experience. Will stop in again when I am in Providence.",couple
2017/04,4,Wonderful maze of history,"The maze of the lay out reminds me of the streets in Boston. But I actually like that it makes it more fun to explore.
The people working there are really helpful. They do not mind any and all questions.
The different sections are laid out for easy viewing.
I am not a big fan of museums but though it is small, it covers quite a bit of history.
I would recommend a visit.",couple

2017/04,4,"Difficult to navigate, but worth exploring","You would think a School of Design could provide a decent map of its collections, but the one I got here was useless! I ended up wandering aimlessly through the galleries, which led to several great discoveries, not least a historic home with remarkable Rhode Island furnishings. Given renovation work, European painting and sculpture are crowded into a single room with no labels or guide. But there are interesting selections of ancient Egyptian, Asian, and Western decorative arts, apart from the historic home, which is a must-see. All in all, this is worth a visit, though I'd encourage the Museum to provide better guidance to visitors, both on the website and in the printed materials offered on site.",Solo
2017/04,5,One of the highlights of Providence,Wonderful museum with a wide range of exhibits. We spent 2 hours here and it was a great experience. Definitely a must-see if you're in Providence.,couple
2016/05,5,Bigger and better than I expected!,"That's what she said. Really, though, I expected a small college museum with a few rooms and ended up with a whole afternoon worth of exploring both traditional and modern works. Nicely curated, and free on Sundays. I plan on going back!",couple
2017/04,4,Bit of a maze but some excellent art,It's a bit confusing to navigate but elevators and friendly security guards were able to direct us to all parts of the museum. I most e joyed the Impressionists and fine sculptures. The museum is being updated but during renovations still excellent. The coffee shop is good too including the young lady who sculpted a fine foam pattern on our coffee and hot chocolate.,Family
2016/07,5,RISDMuseum & Store/Gift Shop,Great Art. Wonderful Bldg. & huge in size. I don't think one can appreciate the whole Bldg. in 1 visit. There is just too much to see.

2017/04,4,Explore,Great stuff - extensive refurb on a number of floors so flow hampered slightly but some interesting and surprising stuff,Family
2017/03,4,Very good college museum with a wide ranging collection.,"First a little caution: the museum is undergoing some renovations and so parts of the collection are unavailable now and there is some confusion in getting around, since a couple of areas are shut off blocking easy access. Nevertheless, the museum holds a very interesting range of art and design from ancient to contemporary, from American and European to Asian. Surprisingly good selection of Egyptian and Greek and Roman art. Also, ancient and some more modern Chinese, Japanese, and Indian. 18th, 19, 20th century American and European works in every medium; then of course there are many items relevant to their mission to teach design. And there are students everywhere, sketching but not so as to be in the way of other patrons. We frequently remarked about how lucky these students are to have such a treasure trove as a part of their college experience.",Couple

2017/03,3,"Though Small, RISD Museum of Art Rises to Meet Expectations","I've lived in walking proximity of the museum for a year and a half, and had never been in until today! I don't know what took me so long to visit this small, but great musuem.

Home to one of the largest Buddah statues in America, this attraction houses many awe inspiring artifacts, such as expertly crafted sarcophagi, ornately painted cartonnage cases that were used to house mummies, and coins from anciant Rome, to name a few.

As someone who doesn't neccessarily lable herself an art enthusiast, I appreciate this museum, because it displays pieces that represent something more tangible to me, rather than showcasing only paintings, which I often seem to lack the emotional response or understanding that is evoked for many people.

When you are in Providence, I highly reccomend paying a visit to this museum, especially on sunday, as it is free admission. Enjoy!",Solo
2017/03,5,A small museum with many gems,"“A delightful museum with a much larger collection than expected. It has a peculiar layout, combining perhaps three buildings, so that in order to exit the way we came in, we had to go up to the 4th floor and then down another elevator. Very enjoyable.”
",
2016/12,5,Great local museum,Its amazing that most of the people that go to this museum are from out of the state visitors. Such a great museum that even local Rhode Islanders do not know about. It has a little of everything and the place is deceiving from the outside as the how big it is after you enter. The help in the museum are so very kind and helpful and will direct you to what you may be most interested in. The place is never crowded and has a nice quietness about it. Great place to roam around in.,
2017/03,3,A Little of a Lot,"The museum has a little of a lot of styles of art. When we visited, it was undergoing renovation. Some floors were closed and it was a bit confusing to find our way around.",couple

2016/12,5,Wide Interests? No Problem!,"This museum offers such a variety of art and design from so many eras that there is bound to be something that appeals to everyone. I loved looking at sculpture, clothing, the old masters and modern furniture design then finding ourselves in a historic house. There are permanent and temporary exhibits so there is always something new when you go. I've been a few times on my own but recently got the chance to go with three generations of my family. What a great time we had! It's great that it's free on Sundays too!",
2017/03,5,Perfect size museum for families,The RISD museum has something for everyone. I was a particular fan of the decorative arts including the Chilhully chandelier and arts and crafts vases. The kids loved the colonial rooms and costumes.,Family
2017/02,4,A must see! Did not expect such a great variety,"Lovely museum, its small size belies what a cornucopia of art treasures I saw here. Didn't expect so many greats. Everything from sublime Buddhist pieces (including one of the largest Buddha statues) to cool, Swedish minimalist furniture ....to textile and fashion pieces ...famous paintings by cezanne, monet, Renoir. All lovingly assembled, but not too overwhelming nor too many that they would wear me out. Cherry on top: it's FREE ON SUNDAYS! Don't miss this.",
2017/02,5,Full of Gems,"Whenever I'm in town, I check to see what the special exhibits are first...but often just wander among the permanent collection since it is full of unexpected treasures.",Friends
2017/02,5,Amazing Artwork,"We never expected to see such a wide variety of art in a college museum. From Egyptian to Roman to classical to contemporary, the Rhode Island School of Design Museum of Art had it all. The only thing missing was student artwork which was in the process of being set up. Friendly and informative staff. One negative is the lack of a parking garage but if you're lucky you'll find a spot on the street.",
2017/02,5,Never disappoints,"Please make a stop here you won't be disappointed! One of my favorite spots to go, mostly for the stories from the staff about the pieces they have. One of my favorites is about the owner of house walk through. They replicated a man's house I don't want to spoil anything just ask when you enter what the deal is with him! The pieces don't really change much in most of the exhibits but the tidbits of info I learn are always new and exciting! The staff are always welcoming and really want to tell you all about their section so please I encourage you ask!",Friends
2017/01,5,Relatively small museum with a diversity of a big one," If design is an attractive issue for you, and you also like to see it in a historical perspective as well as in a global scale, you'll probably spend good time here. With various objects from Asia and Europe, a rich collection of post colonial US and a modest but striking section on contemporary art are all together inspiring. And the museum shop has really original pieces.",Family
2016/06,5,A homecoming of sorts,"I was fortunate to go to RISD back in the 1980's, while I was in school going to the museum was a perk. Now it's a treat, to go back, to see new acquisitions and shows. This is one of The MUST - go to places on a visitation list! To pass this by would be a cultural loss for everyone in your family, every religion, every mind 'could opened' just a little bit more.",couple
2017/01,4,A good museum,"This museum is not big, but it has some interesting exhibits. I like the sculptures and furniture exhibited in the museum, some of which are the work of RISD alums.",
2017/01,5,"First time visit, but not the last, particularly of free Sunday's","The RISD Museum was always on my must see places to visit where it is only a 20 min., less than 14 mile drive from my home. The free Sundays from 10 am - 5 pm and free on street parking which can be a problem on Providence's College Hill anytime of the day or evening, plus a local group organizing a Meetup to see the ""Inventing Impressionists"" exhibit got me off my butt to final go. I was blown away by all the exhibits and galleries and will be back again when I have a free Sunday. One suggestion is to buy the hard bound ""Selected Works"" book in the Chase Lobby gift shop (a bargain at $10) which is cheaper than an adult entrance during regular visiting hours. It will help you learn about many of the artworks on display in the Chase Gallery that do not have tag plates.",Friends

2016/11,4,Incredibly Eclectic,"So many varied types of art and collections. There was something interesting at every turn. It would be helpful if there was actually a map of each floor, but this is a minor drawback to an otherwise fun and refreshing museum. If you have time to let yourself wander, you will get a lot out of enjoyment from this museum.",Friends
2016/11,5,Awesome Aesthetic - Compelling Collection,"You don't just visit the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD Museum), you allow it to envelop you. Stunning, diverse and cleverly curated. It is the quintessential university collection on steroids. The collections span ancient civilization in the east and west, contemporary and modern, paint to porcelain, silver to sculpture, architecture and design. It is a fusion of culture and aesthetic that invites your to drift through the concise but strong collection. One has to meander as the museum encompasses five cleverly interconnected buildings. From the creaking floors of a colonial federalist home to more traditional and modern galleries the setting compliments the collection. Perfect for a rainy day as you'll be occupied for hours - but not to be missed.",couple
2016/11,5,A Favorite small museum experience,"So many great works in the permanent collection. The period rooms are a treat for small ones. all staff welcoming and informed.

","It would be a pity not to visit this smallish powerhouse of a museum if you are in Providence. While the museum is small compared to, say, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it packs in quite a variety of artwork, from Ancient Egypt and Asia to current trends in art and design. The Impressionist area was being renovated, but many important impressionist paintings were downstairs in a special exhibit. Part of the museum’s charm is that it’s part traditional museum and part house. The main drawback is that there is no good map for the complicated, twisty layout. However, the docent “guards” are very helpful. The café is too small to handle the lunch crowd, even on a week day.",couple
2016/10,3,A labyrinth but probably worth it.,"Nifty current impressionist show, Manet, Monet, others and some nice context. You do wander quite a bit when you're there and it's hard to understand the floor maps--mostly you don't believe them--but theyre accurate. No handout upon entry to know where the various exhibits are. You'll be climbing some stairs at this museum. Very nice staff at entry who helped me with a locker and a storage spot for my suitcase--was on a business trip. Cute little gift shop, but with all they have to choose from, it's on the meager side. They, like all museums--why is this?--subscribe to the ""tiny description convention,"" which makes i difficult to read to informative panels by each of the works. So much for 'design' as an enabler of good communication. I'd go back depending on the show they're doing, but only then.",solo

Definitely worth the visit if you have time!,business

2015/11,5,Great Museum that can be experienced in a day,"Many Museums can be overwhelming and mentally exhausting like the Metropolitan Museum in New York, which is amazing, but takes virtually 4-5 days to truly explore. This museum is effective yet just the right amount of size that it doesn't feel as overwhelming as other museums can feel. It's almost symbolic of Rhode Island itself, which is a small state, but has a lot to offer and a lot of incredible sights and locations within it.",Friends

There is art from Egypt, Rome, Asia and rooms completely set up with historical American furnishings. There is also contemporary art and design, as well as a student gallery. The museum winds its way among several floors and it isn't hard to get a little lost, but the staff are there to help you out and share info if you ask.

2016/10,5,Great Collection Of Art And Artifacts,"I was on a recent business trip in Rhode Island and decided to swing by the RISD Museum of Art. The entry fee is $12 and it takes about an hour to hour and half to get through the museum. You could spend more time if you wanted to read all of the information or listen to the audio but for a casual goer it's a little under 2 hours. I was very impressed by the collection of not only art, but artifacts from various time periods. My favorite area was the Egyptian Exhibit with the Tomb and Mummy of Nesmin. The Greek coins and architecture area was a close second. I enjoyed being able to browsed around this extensive museum and then finish in the student art exhibit to see what students of the RISD were creating. Great spot to visit while in Providence.",solo

2016/09,4,"It's a school, a museum and a historic mansion","That tells it all and explains the confusing layout that extends over multiple buildings that are on a steep hill. So the entrance level into the first floor of the historic mansion is on the third (I think) floor of the museum. That said, it's an imaginative museum with period rooms and collections that range from the ancient Egyptian to federal United States to contemporary of the moment. The labels and curating are first-rate. Definitely worth a couple of visits to sort it all out. And we lucked out - free on Sunday.",Family
2016/09,5,RISD MUSEUM,Excellant collection of fashion exhibited at the museum! RISD is such a fascinating campus to visit.,Solo
2016/10,5,Very good collection,"I was so impressed with the depth of this collection. There is something for everyone here: textiles, porcelain, furniture, sculptures as well as Monet, Degas, Braque, Picasso, Warhol and the rest of the more well known artists. This place would hold the interest of many. Well worth a visit.",Friends
2016/09,4,Stunning collection,Stunning collection of European Art which we were interested in. Lovely fashion exhibit too. Cafe a bit sparse but nice food.,couple
2016/10,5,A great collection that will in turn amaze and surprise you!,"We had been recommended to go here by our Airbnb host - a great choice! For a museum on a small site there is so much to see - we ended up going back on a separate day as there were things we had not been able to look at and other items that we wanted to see again. There are three linked museums - we started at the top with the period house which was well explained - rooms are set up to represent different styles and time periods. Good, but not earth shattering. We then went into the art galleries. We have visited many throughout the world and did not expect to see so many paintings of such a diverse range and of such quality. There was a stunning Picasso painted early in his career that you may have thought to be a Lautrec, there were three Monet's including a different version of the ""Poppies"", a van Gogh, Cezanne, a great Morisot. The list of quality painters goes on and on. There are sculptural pieces by Rodin, a superb Lloyd Wright piece of stained glass, modern art including a superb painting called Mooring by Joan Mitchell, a Babylonian lion from 2500 years ago, Japanese inspired print work, medieval carvings. It is so diverse - everybody will find something to admire, enjoy and love in this museum. Give it the time it deserves but do not miss it.",couple
2016/09,5,Small museum with a lovely collection of art,"Located right on Benefit street, this museum is within walking distance of some of the last few free places to park in the city. This was our first time visiting the museum and we had no idea what to expect. We thought, perhaps, that we would be seeing the art and fashion projects of the talented RISD students but it was so much more.

Passing from one room to another you are in the presence of some of the greatest works through the ages including Ancient Greece, Rome, Asia, Egypt, Europe and 18th and 19th century America. You will see works by Degas, Cezanne, Monet, Manet, Picasso, van Gogh and so many more.

There is an entire wing dedicated to the collection of Charles Pendelton which includes furniture, silver, glass, ceramics, textiles, and paintings.

You can spend as little or as much time as you want exploring the many floors. There is a coffee shop if you want to take a break. Not sure the museum is a good fit for younger children.",Couple 
2016/09,4,Main attraction of the town,"Three linked museums; one general museum with stuff from ancient Egypt to modern times, one period house and one of modern art. A very pleasant couple of hours",
2016/08,5,Best museum in Providence,"I have been going to the RISD Museum since the 1980s, and go several times a year. The regular collections - the big wooden Buddha, and the Egyptian exhibits (which are impressive, and include a mummy), and the incredible first-floor gallery of portraits and landscapes - are always worth a look.I come back for the Buddha, and the portraits, and the early Medieval art, and the Roman marblework, and the Napoleonic items. And there's always a new show, which is often an exhibition of newer / 20th century art (recent examples: women's art, fashion). It's always fun, and always worth a look. Five stars.",Couple 
2016/10,4,Small Gem,"You wouldn't expect much since there's not much to see from the outside. We got free admissions from Bank of America but it's apparently free on Sundays. There's is a fair amount of abstract pieces and of course industrial designs and textiles. The Rennaisance art collection is surprisingly large for a college museum. There's a small Asian art collection, which is also interesting.",Couple 
2015/10,5,Nice small museum. Great museum gift shop too.,"A nice way to spend a couple of hours. It's right on Benefit Street. The gift shop as a lot of things that have been designed by RISD grads, some which you might have seen in stores, but many which are not ones you will usually find at your local Target.",Couple
2016/07,5,Amazing Fine Art Collection and Todd Oldham Exhibit!,"I was thoroughly blown away to enter rooms filled with Claude Monet's and Vincent Van Gogh's paintings! The docent was very knowledgeable and shared the rich history of how the museum acquired such fine paintings for it's collection! We were very grateful to have learned so many interesting things about the artwork!

While this collection ended last week, you will not be disappointed by the other exhibits. Plan on spending 1-2 hours here and it certainly is worth it.

Note that if you plan on visiting and you're able to do it on a Sunday do it then since admission is free.",Couple

2016/09,4,Wonderful Small Museum,"RISD Museum does not belong to the citizens of RI, it is an extension of Rhode Island School of Design, therefore a Museum accessible to both the community and legions of visitors who visit the city of Providence. Unlike the great Museums of the world, like the MET in NY City, or Louvre in Paris, RISD Museum is mall and easy to navigate. But in spite of being small it holds a terrific permanent collection and an occasional fine special exhibition. IN the last few years it has expanded in size in spite of its small foundation, and this has added a new in house cafe, Pearl's Cafee and more exhibition space. The Main Gallery is often a place for musical events surrounded by walls filled with art from the collection. It is definitely a Mueum worthy of a visit and appreciation.",
2016/08,5,A jewel of a museum!,"The RISD museum was a delightful surprise. They had a fabulous Todd Oldham retrospective when we were there and it was an amazing array of beautifully displayed ""costumes"" from this high fashion designer. Unfortunately this exhibit closes on September 11, 2016, but if you can get there in the next few days you will not be disappointed. The galleries comprised of art made by recent RISD students are also amazing.",Family
2016/08,5,Endless! What a great time!,"From the outside, especially entering near the cafe, it doesn't seem like the museum will be like much. Boy were we wrong. This museum was HUGE and easy to get lost in (but in a good way!!). It contained a variety of materials, exhibits, and more! We had such a great time. Great balance of modern and fine art.",Couple 
2016/08,5,Nice little museum,The price is just right with this place and with some pieces by Van Gogh and Picasso definitely worth the visit. The security guards were a bit overzealous but I can understand with some of the loud and clueless patrons that were there.,couple
2016/08,4,A lovely small scale museum,"Providence is small. It's art museum is also small. Having said that, this museum has wonderful amount of art both contemporary and historical. I am never disappointed when I visit. Another wonderful thing is that they offer free membership to artists who live in Rhode Island. They also put on a pretty high frequency of evening events.",solo
2016/02,5,Ancient and New!,"This is a beautiful art museum. The giant blue room with all of the paintings is outstanding! If you visit on Sunday, the admission is for free! What a better and relaxing way than to complete any weekend trip or adventure with a free exploration of the powerful art within!",Friends
2016/08,4,excellent Todd Oldham exhibit!,"The RISD Museum has wonderful exhibits, and the current fashion extravaganza is no exception. The galleries are great space and the curatorial staff are superb. However, be patient as the organization of the collection is a bit hodge podge.",Friends
2016/07,2,Over rated,"With all the wonderful reviews this museum got I was excited for my visit. Parking is impossible. If you are trying to locate handicapped parking, there wasn't any available. There is a lot you can park in and pay over $20, but with a wheelchair finding handicapped entrance almost impossible. The paper map of the museum they provide you is difficult to read. The docents in each gallery knew nothing of the exhibits. A lot of the exhibits were very dusty. We went for the fashion exhibit, and as my mother taught me, if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything. So I will say nothing. The bathroom was memorable. Eyeballs. There were a few interesting pieces scattered throughout, but for the admission price and parking availabiliy, not worth it. This is one museum I will not go back to.",Friends

2016/08,5,Wonderful Small Museum,"I love the Rhode Island School of Design Museum. It is an excellent small museum that you can visit in a couple of hours. It is on a different scale from the NYC museums like the Met, the Guggenheim or the MOMA or the Boston Museum of Fine Arts but if you are visiting Provi, it is definitely a must. RI School of Design is a top art school in the country and the museum reflects this.",Couple

2016/08,5,Great Collection,"The RISD museum shows a great collection in a great city. They offer a nice little coffee shop hosted by Bolt Coffee that opens early before the museum, too. The scope of the collection is broad, and being operated under the auspices of a higher ed institution, they present thoughtful exhibitions that often lean toward a focus in design. There is a gallery of student work, and the shop features products designed by RISD grads. The museum has expanded in recent years and is a great place to spend a few hours. Staff is friendly and exhibitions are presented in a way that makes them fun and easy to enjoy. Not a stuffy place at all!",business
2016/08,4,Free on Sundays,We stopped at the museum before driving home on Sunday since it's free on Sundays. They have a good collection - it took us a little over and hour to see the stuff that we were interested in.,Couple
2016/08,4,A little bit of everthing,"RISD once you figure out how to get in the building is a fine visit for a short time.

They cover many different subjects from fashion to ancient Egypt but none very deep so it a good survey location.

I went for the federal period furniture and indeed the 6 or so room displays have some fine examples. The lighting could be better and there is no ability to get more information but the examples are stunning.

We also enjoyed the fashion displays which many would like.

One tip, parking is hard but the lot by the white church, Metro, has not signs to tell you this but if you get their ticket validated by the museum, it is half price.",couple
2016/08,5,Small but neat museum,Don't pass up a chance to attend this little gem. An eclectic collection ranging from Ancient Egypt through current student exhibits. All well displayed. Very enjoyable.,couple
2016/02,5,What a surprise,"This is a really cool museum with some world class art and artifacts. I've been by it many times, but never knew it would be so good. Great staff and gift shop too. Very manageable if you are on a tight schedule and definitely worth the trip.",business
2016/08,5,Excellent range of art,A great range of art from Egyptian to modern art. Quite a few famous artists paintings as well as Rodin sculptures. Also the fashion exhibition was very interesting by Todd. Layout can be tricky to navigate but it was well worth the effort,Family
2016/07,5,Spent a Few Great Hours on Our Vacation,"Had a wonderful afternoon visiting the museum while in Providence. There was a special Tod Oldham exhibit was was wonderful . Dozens of dressed mannequins, videos, behind there fashion stories and scenes -- really great. Lots of other things to see as well and I'd make it a must stop when visiting Providence, They have a little cafe there on there ground floor.",couple

2016/08,5,Only had time for two exhibits but great,"This museum was free with a military ID. It was hard to find free parking, but once inside this was an world-class museum.

2016/08,4,A really nice museum,"A very good museum with high quality. I especially loved their glass collection, but I also found quite a few gems along their paintings. There is really something for everybody. The special exhibition on fashion and clothes design was terrific and fun. The building itself is wonderful even though you can get a bit lost on where you have been and what's still to be seen. I would have liked them to number the rooms so you could follow the numbers to be sure you see it all.
If you have parked in the nearby parking lot, be sure to get your ticket stamped by the museum. It reduces the pay with about 50%.",Family
2016/08,5,A must see.,"An amazing Todd Oldham exhibit was on while we were there. I'm not all that into fashion, but this was truly spectacular. However, the student gallery was tremendous. Make sure you visit while in Providence. You can be in and out in under an hour, as well.",couple

Cute gift shop where some serious damage could be done if you don't practice self control! But also a good place to find special gifts.,couple
2016/08,4,Great Selection of Art!,"Wonderful selection of artistic styles and antiquities, but a little disappointed at the lack of more modern sculptures.

2016/08,4,Hoped for more,"The RISD has such a great reputation that I was a little disappointed. They have a fine arts museum, and were showing avant-garde works by students and a fashion designer with roots in Turin, Italy. But, I wanted more. I wanted their store to be like the MOMA's in NYC. Full of exciting new designs. I wanted to see more from their best students, past and present. We all need more art!",Family
2016/08,5,Must see,I wish we could have spent several more hours at this wonderful museum. It is a great balance between works of RISD alums and other artists. It is bigger than I thought it would be. We will go back.,
2016/05,4,"Expected more, but all in all, was nice","As my personal expectation and as a designer myself, I was hoping for a more contemporary exhibit, but the building is gorgeous (albeit difficult to navigate inside, even with the map), and the different exhibits were interesting. Nice checking the gift shop on our way out! Went on a Sunday, so the free admission was nice! The entrance is hard to find, and looking for parking spaces outside takes time, even though it was a cloudy & cold day, had to walk a couple of blocks.",couple

2016/07,4,Feeding the mind while expanding horizons,"I took my niece (12) to RISD Museum because they had a fashion display. Knew she'd love it, and she did. But she also loved the furniture and interiors. She was especially attracted to the minimalist and arts and crafts tables. That was surprising to me. She walked out of there seeing herself wearing a stylish gown while designing highly refined and functional furniture. She talked about it the whole way home. She may not grow up to be a furniture designer, or clothing designer, or any job that exists today. The point is to offer the possibility and this place does a wonderful job of displaying beautiful pieces from a variety of styles and periods. We'll be back",Family

I loved how some areas were curated with furniture interspersed with antique clothing and modern sculpture, really interesting and it sounds like it shouldn't work but it did.

Also some interactive exhibits where you could click on images on a tablet for details about a painting.

Even the 6-year old loved it. The buildings are gorgeous and even though it seems like a small museum, there is a lot there.

We only spent 2 hours but could have spent twice that in an all-adult un-rushed trip. Even with only 2 hours, it was well worth the entry price. Apparently it is even free on Sundays.

Don't miss the Pearl Cafe in their lobby for excellent cappuccino and other treats.",Family
2016/07,5,Nice collection in a teaching museum,"First for new things: there is a coffee shop (Benefit St. Entrance) with a limited menu of the most expensive coffee in Providence, some baked goods and small plates. The space is quite nice and I think when school is in session it will be impossible to get a seat. The museum has a nice permanent collection and usually a very good rotating show. What I like is that it is turning into a teaching museum - for both artists and, I suspect, for museum students. Therefore the information along with the exhibits is always interesting. Parking can be a problem on weekdays but worth the hassle because the gallery's are somewhat empty.",Friends
2016/07,3,Average except for Todd Oldham exhibit.,"Nothing much to add. I have said it all but I appreciate the reviews.

2016/05,5,Must-Do in Providence unless you're an anti-museum person,"My husband and I, looking for a good ""Day-cation"" decided to drive over to Providence for a single Saturday. Neither of us had been there before.
Of all the things we did that day: walking along the Federal Hill area and Benefit Street, seeing the WaterPark area and the Gondola rides, checking out the Providence area mall and trying out an area seafood restaurant, this museum was far and above the highlight of our day.
While not a Smithsonian, to be sure, it offers a wide range of different exhibits covering all areas of the world and ranging in type from the art of fashion (a featured exhibit on the Todd Oldham studios and some of the STRANGE fashions they have produced) to examples of biblically-inspired paintings and sculptures to artifacts from colonial New England and Ancient Egypt.
If I had to make any less than positive observations about this museum I could only say:
1. The museum does its best to fit inside several adjacent buildings in the middle of busy urban Providence, so it's forced to conform to the rooms available for it. As such, it's layout is somewhat confusing. It's hard to tell what you've covered already and what you haven't
2. Similarly, some of the pieces on display that are ""one-offs"" are nestled among exhibits that they are only tangentially related to, like one example of a random glass statue of fruit in a room filled with ancient roman artifacts (and no, the placard on the glass fruit made it clear it did not come from ancient Rome).
Just be sure to follow their rules about bringing food or drink in! I had my travel mug of tea and forgetfully opened it to drink, only to be politely reminded by an attendant that that was not allowed. My Bad!",Couple

Artists: Alice Neel, Cy Twombley, Ellsworth Kelly.... Impressed by how it's curated.",Family
2016/05,4,Arguable hidden gem,"Definitely spend the $5-12 and visit this museum! It has a wide variety of art exhibits, from ancient Egyptian to modern fashion. It's in the heart of downtown Providence. Take a walk uphill three blocks to then visit the grounds of beautiful Brown. The gift shop doesn't offer much if you're looking for unique gifts/shopping, but then that's not why museums exist. Staff were friendly and very accessible. Extra points for the multiple gender inclusive restrooms.",
2016/05,4,Tod Oldham retrospective is dazzling,"Met Costume exhibit -- you have met your match on this one! Tod Oldham recently donated dozens of his exotic creations to RISD. They are amazing. The designs are flawless, but it is what he had done to fabric that will shine. Making his own fabrics, based on everything from shredded newspapers, to Persian carpets, from black and blue zebras to Scottish Fair Isles, he transforms the fabrics into treasures. A plain wide wale navy cordoroy, for example, becomes brilliant when 10000s of jet beads are sewn between the wales. A Fragonard painting is stitched onto a silk dress; bullion is embedded in gown designs [and sweaters, and slacks]. Then there are the pipe cleaners, etc. Go see it. It is a testament of the eye of an artists focused on the most minute detail to create the look he wants.",Friends
2016/05,5,"Excellent museum, chance to explore incredible art",I was able to tour the museum this week with a group of colleagues. The pieces are so interesting and the exhibits seem to change regularly. It is quite amazing to see what these students can produce. There is a reason RISD is the best art school in the world. I also took the time to walk around the campus into other buildings to see art in the making.,business
2016/05,5,Loved it!,"I'm not much of an art person, but I decided to go to this museum. The museum is free to all RISD, Brown, RIC, CCRI, and URI students and $5 for all other college students. Really cheap, totally worth the money if you have to pay. From the looks of the outside I thought the museum was really small and that we'd be done within an hour but we were there for two hours and we missed many exhibits. When visiting measure your time wisely and make sure to spend at least two hours here. Loved it! Will definitely be going back! Parking is a hassle in this area though, only downside.",Friends
2016/05,5,"Great Fashion Exhibit - from Beads, Buttons to Bows","While in Providence on a cloudy day, I decided to take in the RISD museum with its fashion exhibit. Worth the visit- just stunning and intricate detailing for designs

As they are getting a bit old for our annual pilgrimage to the zoo, we decided to venture into Providence. It just so happened that the 90's fashion designer, Todd Oldham, had a 65 dress exhibit. We were simply awed by the intricate designs and finite details of beading, color combinations and unique materials used to create these works of art. Wow. If you are looking for something fun to do with your daughters, mom or girlFriends, this is the perfect way to spend an afternoon (Apr 7 - Sep 11, 2016.) We were each presented with a small button, courtesy of his shop that created custom buttons for his designs. There are a number of small coffee shops and artsy places to have light lunches, as it's nestled in the historic district. The rest of the museum also offered a variety of exhibits including Egyptian, Roman, Fine Works Gallery of various oils, modern and textiles.

An amazing display of design items from clothing, to jewelry, to furniture and fabrics. A huge collection of artwork as well. I can't believe I was able to see an encaustic painting from the Egyptian era! My favourite thing out of all.

Well worth a stop. Make sure you check out the gift shop before you leave and hop across the street to see the art store if you are so inclined.",Friends
2016/04,5,Varied,We loved this museum. The variety of art is vast from ancient Asia to contemporary. We were there for the Todd Oldham exhibit and could not stop looking. This is worth the trip to Providence. The museum shop offered some fun pieces.,Friends

2016/03,5,Beautriful and Peaceful !,"Beautiful and peaceful. Just the change of pace we needed while keeping up with our son, a graduate student at the school next door. It was Spring Break for them, so we had a bit more flexibility of moving about the campus. And while we visited same time last year, the mood was more relaxed this time around. Maybe because it was a weekday, and less crowded. Or maybe because I looked forward this time to the charming collection of gems from Europe, Asia and America. And how I loved that Van Gogh...

And don't forget the Museum Store. Got a charming little pin for my niece.",Family

When I arrived I thought we would see a couple of interesting pieces and be on our way, but I was pleasantly surprised by the extensive and impressive collection from paintings to sculptures, artifacts to furniture, photography to pottery, and more. The Impressionist pieces are lovely and I was quite taken by an early Picasso. It's not a very large museum but it has a lot to offer and should not be missed.",couple

2016/03,4,Wide variety for a small museum,"I love art museums, especially small-scale museums at colleges/universities. I did not fall in love with this one, though. That may say more about my frame of mind at the time than the museum itself, however. It costs $12 for admission. There is a mix of contemporary art, ancient artifacts, furniture, and fashion. That means there is a bit of something for everyone. On the other hand, there are not acres of paintings to get lost in. But all in all it is a nice place to spend an hour.",Solo
2015/06,5,Great place to learn!,"I have always liked artsy things. When I taught school, the fourth grade trip was to RISD. It was fabulous! The docents are so nice, and for the most part they are great with kids. The exhibits change regularly, so if you were there last year there will be something new to see this year. I highly recomment RISD. Even if you go with a non-artsy type, by the time you leave, they may convert!",Family

2016/02,4,"We only had an hour, but we saw some great art!","the Grand Gallery and enjoyed the paintings very much. We then took in the Greek & Roman rooms, the impressionists, and finally the Jesse Burke photographs. We loved everything we saw! The museum docents were very kind and helpful. I know that if we had had more time, we would have seen everything in more depth, but even our quick visit fulfilled our need for some excellent art. There were placards with detailed information available, and the museum is clean, comfortable, and inviting.",couple
2016/01,5,Solid collection,"This museum is on the medium-small side, but it's collection is solid. What it lacks in quantity, it makes up for in quality (pardon the cliche). One of the great perks of its size is that the art seems more palatable-- it doesn't feel overwhelming or heavy, and you don't have to rush your visit. You'll want to visit again, maybe later in future, because the pieces are worth a second look, and not because you didn't get to see everything the first time. In that sense, this museum is very satisfying.",
2016/02,4,Wonderful Collection of Art,"This museum was much bigger and better than I expected. I went with my daughter who had to do an assignment for a college course expecting it to be RISD student art, which would have been fine. It is a large, very well laid out museum of art from many periods of time. There is modern art and very old art from Medieval times with art from periods in between. It also includes furniture, dishes, sculpture and decorated, furnished rooms from different periods in time. I especially enjoyed the small collection of Impressionist art, Jesse Burke photography exhibit, and the hall of paintings (mostly portraits). We spent about two hours going through the museum, taking our time. The parking lot (about two blocks away) pointed to on their website offers a discount to RISD Art Museum visitors during the week, but is a $6 flat rate on Saturdays.",Family
2016/01,5,Wonderfully laid out with great works of art.,We went to the Museum on a warmish January day. The paintings are laid out very well with some work done by well known and not well known artists. Every aspect of what would you see in a museum was there. The house attached gave two looks into history.,couple
2015/12,4,Not Just For Students,"I must take exception to the assumption made that this museum is for the students at RISD! The RI Art Association began its crusade to establish the Museum long before RISD was established as a school- and for a museum this size, it manages to display an amazingly rich and varied cross section of creative works.

The RISD Museum a fascinating and quirky place. The Pendleton House, which features beautiful period furniture and craftsmanship that rivals the Newport Mansions, is an actual house which was built in 1906 as a replica of the residence owned by Charles Pendleton. When I first began visiting the Museum it was a complete pain in the butt to figure out which staircase to use to get from one side of the Museum proper to the other, because this house sits right in the middle of the building! It is rumored that ghosts have been seen roaming the upper halls.

The museum’s Farago Wing has constantly changing shows that reflect the best in contemporary and cutting edge art. The new Chace Center has its own theatre and plays host to visiting artists and art films and the permanent collection, which features art from Asia, India, and the ancient world, contains one of the few true “charged” Buddhas in the Western world. This massive, serene statue sits quietly in its own shadowed room and every visitor is hypnotized by the palpable aura which surrounds the statue. I have seen it quiet throngs of screaming children within seconds.

In the summer, on the third Thursday of every month, the RISD Museum spills out onto the streets in true block party style, with events, music and excited crowds that throng until closing at 9pm.

My one regret is that the vast pre-Columbian collection which the Museum owns seldom makes it to the upper levels. I was astonished to discover that the visitor’s collection is only the tip of a giant iceberg of art which remains sleeping through the centuries in the basement archives.",
2015/03,4,Nice little art museum,"This museum is for the students at RISD, so it's got a wide selection but not a deep one. My favorite part was the small collection of Roman and Greek art.

It's a nice place to go for an hour or two.",Family

2015/12,5,Terrific museum,"We have lived not too far away for a great many years and only finally have made it to the RISDI Museum. We thought it was just a museum of students' works, but it is a first rate art museum with many classic artists' works. We absolutely loved it.",
2015/12,4,Impressive and eclectic collection and a Beethoven Concert,Took a day trip from Boston to check out the collection. I was very impressed. The building is interesting with both modern and old sections. The art was varied with some beautiful pieces from a wide range of periods. It was free admission on Sunday. we were also treated to a Beethoven concert in the main hall of the museum. What an amazing find. Definitely a must visit when in New England.,Friends
2015/12,5,"Very nice collections, a bit of everything","This is a very nice and varied collection. Especially interesting egyptian and oriental works,as well as early American furnishings and art.
The huge carved wooden buddha shown in the picture is one of the most magical museum pieces! It fills an entire room. It is wonderful to just sit in the room with this statue and relax your body and mind... take him in.
The museum has special prices and programs throughout the year. They offer art classes for kids that are wonderful. I took both of my kids when they were young, for weekly classes, and we still have some of their creations at my house, many years later.
Located on ""college Hill"" where the RISD campus kind of melts into the Brown campus. There are beautiful historic homes and buildings in this neighborhood, and many great restaurants and little shops just up the hill, on Thayer St.
i have been there many times over the years, kids all grown up now, and one of them graduated from an art school :))

2015/11,5,Lovely variety of exhibits,"The RISD museum offers a wide variety of different exhibits suitable to anyone's tastes, from the post-modern to the surreal to the classical. You'll find Monet just a floor above exhibits of drapes or ink splots or whatever it is the Bohemians are calling art these days. There's also a beautiful reconstruction of a classic Providence home - some of the furniture on display (both in the recreated home and outside of it) is absolutely singular, particularly the separate display of the late 19th century silver desk and chair set. There are also exhibits on older art and design, including the massive, ancient wooden Buddha statue. There's really just something for everyone's taste here, and it's absolutely worth a visit - even if you think that post-modern art and abstract art is utter rubbish.",

2015/09,4,Good Smaller Museum,"The museum has a variety of art, including contemporary, Asian, 18th-19th century European, plus some student work, some of which was very good. But the map/guide is hard to use; it doesn't show a floor plan, as most museum guides do. Instead it shows a side view, listing what is on each floor. So it was a little hard to navigate around. Also, in the large gallery with many European paintings, there is one Ipad which can't be moved, so it was hard to find out what each painting was. It would be much better if they had plastic sheets that you could pick up",Solo

Some stuff was out there, not necesarily my cup of tea but some were very well composed and seemingly effortless, coming from the soul instead of the hands of the artists.

My favorite sections were the impressionists, the contemporary and the 3D sculptures/designs. Warhol, Renoir, Monet and my favorites, Van Gogh and Degas, were on display. The porcelain display was also new to me and captured my interest. I'm used to the blue Delft type of ceramics but these displays had very delicate figurines of people and animals, in a variety of poses. The Pendleton house gave a glimpse into early 20th century living, nicely maintained if this interests you.

Overall a nice museum but shouldn't be a primary reason to come to Providence.

And I fully agree that money does buy happiness, because ""Happiness Is Expensive"" - Alejandro Diaz, neon lights installation. Ignorance is the other avenue to the illusion of Happiness.",
2015/08,5,RISDE,"This is a fabulous campus-beautiful in every sense!. The RISDE permanent collection is ENTIRELY worth a trip to Rhode Island. It is entirely a gem. After the museum, go to tje bookstore, and then you should walk down Benefit Street- beautiful historical homes etc. Could not find any trash in RI- a very clean city. Eat at Heminways- great seafood!!.",Friends
2015/09,4,A gem,"If you are visiting PVD and you appreciate art, a stop at the RISD museum is a must. For a small museum it has a good collection of American artists as well as international. The old part of the museum is an architectural beauty in itself.",couple
2015/09,5,My favorite art museum,"We've visited RISD twice and have been very pleased both times. This museum benefits from not being overwhelming in size but still has a nice variety of excellent displays. There are student works presented and works of the Masters as well. I love the blue room with dozens of oil paintings covering the walls.

There's a cafe and gift shop within the building. We stopped midway through our visit for a drink and a snack, which prevented tour fatigue.

The building is well prepared for wheelchair visitors. We had no problem seeing all of the exhibits.",couple
2015/08,5,Great place to spend the afternoon.,"There is a lot to this museum. Some ancient artifacts, some modern art, some reconstructions of living quarters. There is a lot to see and do in this museum. It is located on Providence's East Side In the heart of the Brown University campus, it is definitely worth checking out!",Friends
2015/09,5,Best part of RISD,This place was voted the best museum associated with a school. We are fortunate to have a child as a student here and are able to view the facilities. A must see.,Family
2015/08,5,An Art History Lesson in 1.5 Hrs,"This small museum has shocking breadth. Take advantage of any guides or tours available, and enjoy a walk through a very impressive collection.",solo
2015/08,5,A great museum to take a family with an introduction to many ranges of art.,"The museum offers a great introduction for kids to the world of art museums while offering adults an opportunity to see many pieces in a compact setting. The museum offered the opportunity to see Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Asian, European masters, American and many contemporary pieces. The wide range with manageable size and scope was a nice introduction for kids. I feel the Art Institute in Chicago, LACMA in Los Angeles and Museum of Fine Art in Boston are all amazing facilities and so worth a visit but the challenge is doing it with younger children. The RISD gives you the opportunity to focus without room after room and show them what a Picasso or Monet or ancient pieces look like. The kids really enjoyed thinking about seeing Greek and Egyptian pieces that went back thousand of years. Free on Sundays which is great. The Benefit Street Entrance toward the back had ample free street parking for 2 or 3 hours depending on how far you would like to walk. Close to Brown University too for a quick tour through the campus. Very Nice!",Family
2015/08,4,Small but high quality museum,"This Museum offers a wide range of Art works.
The American decorative Arts,Asian Art and European paintings are some of the highlights.
Only drawback is the quirky layout of the galleries as the Museums straddles several buildings.",couple
2015/07,4,A Little Something for Everyone,"The RISD Museum is a great place to go to see a bit of art, ruminate over old and new items and get a touch of Rhode Island history as well. It has a lot of variety for a small museum and its well thought out enough that you can experience the variety with every turn you make walking through. Going into the Pendleton House section is like stepping into a Rhode Island time warp. Worth the visit...",Solo
2015/08,5,Beyond expectations,My wife and i had a couple of hours to kill in Providence and decided to give this little museum a try: WOW. For such a small place they pack it all in. To really enjoy it all make sure to give yourself at least three hours.,couple

2015/08,5,"Fabulous, and free on Sundays","We really enjoyed the RISD Museum - huge variety of art, sculpture, etc and from many periods and cultures.

2015/08,5,RISD Museum - Wonderful,Wonderful small and manageable museum packed into six floors. Was amazed at the diversity of the collection and impeccable condition of the building. Lady in the gift shop was most helpful. Truly enjoyed the visit.,Friends
2015/08,5,Always a delight,We have visited this museum several times and have always found something new and delightful each time. Our recent visit with a friend enabled us to see the Museum through her experience. The wonderful variety of artistic expression as well as the masterful combination of a stately mansion with a sensitive addition will keep the visitor coing back time and time again.,Friends

2015/08,5,"Wonderful art, well displayed and lit.","This is simply an outstanding museum. It has a great collection of art from most all periods. The art is very well displayed and lit. Pictures are allowed, no flash, and seldom do you get a bad reflection. The art is very accessible. We loved the buildings as well. Do get one of the guides as the 5 houses are well connected, but you could easily miss something without the guide. And allow enough time. We took several hours, and I could have easily spent a day if I were to have sat in each room that I wanted to.",Friends
2015/08,5,A totally accessible museum that's not too big and not too small!,"The RISD museum is a little gem in the heart of downtown Providence. The collections of textiles, paintings, sculpture, furniture, and pieces from ancient Greece and Egypt are in superb condition. The staff are helpful and friendly and visitors can get close enough to the art - nothing, aside from the staged rooms of furniture, is roped off. The highlight, for me, was Rodin's magnificent sculpture, ""The Hand of God.",couple
2015/08,4,You will be surprised how much you will love it.,It is small but enjoyable. It feels like a personal intimate place. It was well laid out. We spent about 3 hours there.,couple
2015/08,5,My favourite place.,Just loved this art gallery. Every room was a gem and the depth of the collection was impressive. Can't wait to go back!,Family
2015/08,5,"Worth a visit, not just modern student art, but a lot of history, period rooms, and excellent furniture.","I have been wanting to visit RISD for a long time. Had no idea it had so much historical art and history on display. A small area has student exhibits. Snacks available in the gift shop. If you like art and history, don't miss it.",couple
2015/08,5,Worth a visit!,A gem of an art museum that regularly rotates through its extensive collection. Visiting exhibits are also top notch. A bit of everything covering almost all tastes.,
2015/04,4,"Quiet, plan 2 hours","Staff are warm and welcoming. Good facilities and very good exhibits. Many aspects of design are covered in the rooms, my favorite was the Vanderbilt clothing section.",
2015/08,5,Great museum,"There's something for everyone here. I'm not a big ceramics fan, so that didn't do much for me. But we really liked the historical furniture, the textiles and many of the paintings. Definitely worth a visit.",couple
2015/08,4,relaxing,"A nice small museum with a diverse collection. Easy to see everything. Some exhibits were confusing as objects in a case are not numbered. And, it was free on Sunday in the summer.",Family
2015/08,3,small exquisite collection,"The RISD museum was a bit hard to find with an entrance 1/2 way down a street and few direction signs. There are 4 floors of exhibit and the pieces we saw were very representative of excellence in design from a Chihuly Chandelier to custom made gowns. However, I was a bit disappointed in the limited amount of pieces on display. Guess I'm spoiled by the MET and MoMA.

If you are in Providence, however, it is definitely worth while to visit. The neighborhood is also worth viewing with some lovely old homes and a First Church.",couple
2015/08,4,Nice Art Museum,Visited here while in town. It's a nice museum as far as setting. It has a wide selection of periods and types of art. I more enjoyed the historical home that a part of the museum was housed in. It is rather a maze to go through but not too difficult if you keep your brochure map.😊 If you enjoy art museums I'm sure you will find it enjoyable.,business
2015/07,3,Eclectic collection,"An interesting and eclectic collection of pieces. Highlights were the restored house, and the tiny textile room (where we opened every drawer). Unfortunately, the student collection rooms were not open when we were there.",Friends
2015/08,5,Wonderful art and textile museum.,"We visited the RISD Museum of Art on a Saturday morning. After an easy 10 minute walk from the Hotel Providence, we enjoyed a comprehensive museum experience at a very reasonable cost compared to other similar museums we've visited. The museum itself is kept up very well, with exhibits appropriately lit and set up for optimal viewing. My only complaint was the lack of maps at registration. There were plenty of restrooms and many benches and other seating for the comfort of visitors. Also, there was a small gift shop serving coffee and a few snacks that we did not check out. Definitely worth a visit.",couple
2015/08,3,A nice museum and Free on Sundays,WE just got lucky and happened upon the museum on a Sunday when it is free. It does a great job of showing the art in a setting that represents the time period of place of origin.,Family
2015/07,5,Great air conditioned walk on a hot day!,"Great walkabout in the museum. Lots to see. But I really would have liked to see more documentation of what the displays were, including the walls of artwork.",couple
2015/08,3,A Fine Collection in a Maze,"A nice varied collection is housed in this museum. Unfortunately, though there is a new addition and many recent changes, this museum is a maze to get through. There is no natural flow and hard to find your way around. The paper map they provide is not easy to follow. Most of the paintings and objects are well marked with the exception being the royal salon where a very large number of paintings hang up the high walls with one ipad on the table in the middle to check appropriate information. While we were there a couple of kids were playing with the ipad and we did not have the opportunity to read any explanations. The museum is free on Sunday.",Family
2015/07,5,Centuries of top-notch art in a compact package,"As a card-carrying Chicago Art Institute member, I have high expectations for art museums. What I love about the RISD museum is that you are exposed to many periods of great art in a short period of time. The museum is organized and curated really well so you can experience works from great artists from ancient (check out the immense Buddha) to modern simply by moving from floor to floor. At a larger art museum, you can get lost in one type of art (e.g., Impressionists at the Art Institute). At RISD, there is an exciting sense of movement as you move from period to period. You get the sense of the influences of history on later works of art. The pieces they exhibit are impressive, and, from what I understand, only a small fraction of what they own. I definitely want to come back to see what ""new"" things they pull from their collection.
The RISD shop is interesting, too. They are unique in that the items they sell are designed exclusively by RISD alumnae and students.
I went for an afternoon...spent probably 2 to 2 1/2 hours. I felt like I saw a lot, but would have liked to spend another hour or so.",Friends
2015/07,5,Something for everybody,"Great museum with a wide variety of art: antiquities, ancient European and Middle Eastern artifacts, a section which was an old manor house decorated with furniture from the time period, paintings and other media pieces from older to current.",couple
2015/05,5,Make the Time to Go,"One of my favorite museums! Funky and always interesting. RISD is always willing to take risks. Nice little shop too. It's near everything else, so I suggest a stop by.",business
2015/07,5,Great small museum,"This museum has a wide range of pieces, including some great Egyptian and Greek/Roman artifacts, and lovely Impressionist paintings. The museum building is comprised of several old houses, so the building has some nice architecture. Really worth a visit and plan to spend an hour or two. The only downside is that parking is hard to find, so we drove around a bit and parked several blocks away.",couple
2015/07,4,"Wide Variety, It will Intreeg","I only spent about 1 1/2 hours here as I had a lot on my list to see! This could have easily been an entire day.

There is something for everyone:
Impressionist, Renaissance, Modern, Textile, Furniture, Egyptian, Chinese, Etc.

There is a beautiful Chilhuly ( same guy who did the ceilings of the Bellagio in Vegas ) chandelier my the Egyptian exhibit.

Don't be so distracted by the art that you miss the beauty of the building itself: beautiful windows, high ceilings, interesting curves.",Friends
2015/07,5,Wide variety in the displayed collection,Well worth a visit with lots of different types of art and objects to see and learn about. Spacious and never crowded.,business
2015/07,5,Spend a day,"What a beautiful and diverse museum. I especially appreciated the elegance of design that was so in evidence. The modernity of many sections was a brilliant contrast to the neighborhood which you could glimpse at intervals. Wear comfy shoes, your will want to see it all!",Family
2015/07,5,Intriguing exposure to unique and priceless works of art and design.,"I was excited by many works of historic proportions, reminiscent of ancient Roman Empire to Newport historic cabinetry. Works of Abstract, realism and historic proportions. I was overwhelmed and impressed. Daily pass allows visitors to come and go during one admission day. Very smart considering how the genres interlude with every step, like taking breath, you have to step away for a bit to experience it all.",
2015/07,5,Art,"Great museum! A diverse collection of pieces from various ages. More than just art, many cool artifacts.",couple
2015/07,5,Gem,What a surprise this was! This little museum has EVERYTHING! From Degas ballerina to some pretty amazing designer collections. Not to mention Frank Loyd Wright's desk! I cannot get enough of this place. And it's free on Sindays. Open late on Thursdays.,solo
2015/02,5,A lot to appreciate in an easy setting,"A small gem of a museum in a charming historic and collegiate area, with a permanent collection ranging from primitive and Greco-Roman to impressionists and modern and interesting rotating special exhibits.",
2015/07,4,Interesting musuem,"Make sure you allow at least a couple of hours to explore the RISD--there is a lot to see! Nice mix of paintings, sculptures, and even some furniture designs. The docents are very helpful--if you go to touch something they come right over! (I used that line on my wife, who should have known better than to leave me unattended in an art museum!) I especially enjoyed the student section where the final projects of the grad students were on display. Well done!",
2015/07,5,Very good collection,"We saw a little bit of everything, from Egiptian art and coffins to great modern art, going through very nice impressionism art.",Family
2015/05,5,5 Stars,"The RISD Museum has one of the finest collections of art that I have ever seen. From the Egyptian room to the Giant Buddha, there is something here for everyone.

Good tip: it's FREE ADMISSION on Sundays!",

2015/07,5,First time to an art museum.,I really enjoyed myself and found most areas to be quite interesting. Some of the personal collections that were on display were immense. The building is a little confusing to navigate but overall a great place to visit.,couple
2015/07,5,Stunning exhibits,"Everything from the mummy to the American furniture, each exhibit was enjoyable in its own right. We spent a solid 2 hours wandering around and enjoying all the different types of art. I especially enjoyed the clothing and textiles displayed in the glass room. That area is not to be missed.",couple
2015/07,5,Great attraction for art lovers passing through providence,"A sucker for fashion exhibits, the Rhode Island School of Design's RISD Museum becomes a stopping point between NYC and Cape Cod.

While admission is $5 for students (with ID) and $12 for adults, it's worth the price when compared to other museums and attractions charging the same fee.

With 6 floors of exhibition space and an interactive textile library, the RISD Museum surprises me with NYC museum caliber installations. The exhibit space is larger than I expected and the content is designed and arranged similar to any other well-curated exhibit I've seen.

Walking through the Modern and contemporary galleries, it's interesting to see clothing designers paired alongside furniture and art (by notable architects and industrial designers). The tightly curated selection of artifacts is a testament to the creativity that continues shaping ""fine art"" throughout the world.

If you choose to visit, be sure to stop into the textile library on the 6th floor. Enter through the glass doors and the fun begins-- pull out the drawers and use the ipads to learn more about the objects inside.",couple
2015/06,4,a surprise.,This school was touted by several of our guides a Americas best. We found wonderful french impressionist works but not much of the work of people who had been students. Strange experience but still worth a visit,couple
2015/07,3,Parking woes,"“Nice museum with a little bit of everything. What's unique is the intact Federal style house. It's like a house inside the museum.

Difficult parking. Find the surface lot diagonal from the First Baptist Church. Half price if you get your parking ticket validated at the museum.”",
2015/06,4,RISD,"Nice museum. It's not huge or complex, but there was a decent mix of paintings and sculptures. This was the ideal place to wander on a random Sunday in Providence.",Friends
2015/06,5,Gem of a museum !,"I was incredibly impressed by this museum. A broad collection, with everything from Egyptian mummies, to Frank Lloyd Wright furniture, from Monet paintings, to 19th century photographs, and on and on. If you take your time, you could spend half a day here. I spent close to 2 hours, and that was rushing through most rooms. If you have a day or 2 in Providence, and like art, this should be near the top of your list. Also, it is on Benefit street, which is probably the best street in Providence for sightseeing ,looking at interesting architecture, RSID and Brown university campuses, and sights like the First Baptist church, and the Atheneum library.",couple
2015/06,4,Not a didactic place,A lot of nice artefact but difficult to understand what kind of museology is behind the display. There is no chronology...,Family
2015/06,4,Boy Scout trip,Lots of interesting things to see. The young boys were treated well and had a good time. The exhibits were explained to their understanding.,Friends
2015/06,4,Beautiful area - nice collection,"For a top art school, I was a bit surprised that the school's collection was nice, but fairly average. With one whole floor dedicated to early American furniture and another floor displaying a few paintings by the best known artists the collection as a whole is underwhelming but worth a walk to the museum to enjoy the beautiful architecture of the neighborhood - which is amazing.",Friends
2015/06,5,Art at its Best,"clean, interesting and varied. Rodin's Eye of God was arresting. Everyone- docents and cashiers- were extremely helpful.",Couple
2015/06,4,Lovely museum with fascinating exhibits,"Small and cozy, but jam-packed with ceramics, fibers, both antique and contemporary art works. Well curated, good variety of exhibits throughout the year.",couple
2015/06,3,Worth Visiting,"I think my expectations were perhaps too high for this museum. I had heard that it was such a gem of a small museum, and I must admit I was a bit disappointed. It is definitely worth a visit and I would never discourage someone from going, but I was surprised by how difficult it was to find one's way around and how poor signage was both for directions and for the artwork. We did enter at the upper level and perhaps starting at the lower entrance would be easier, but we didn't get any advice from the woman working at the desk and were handed a pretty useless map. The eclectic display of textiles, furniture and art on one of the lower floors was really interesting, but I think the whole experience could be improved with some better display and organization.

The gift shop has some very interesting items.",Friends
2015/06,5,Extensive collections!,Have been visiting since I was a child and there is always something new to see. Variety of collections is exceptional.,Friends
2015/04,4,College Options,"Visited the school as part of a counselor's tour. The school has a very interesting vibe, located right across from Brown University and sharing classes between campuses. Very intense but at the same time very free spirited. The facilities are perfect for the creative and certainly represent an outstanding opportunity for students looking for perfecting the creative vein! The campus is very urban and spread within the old part of town.",business
2015/06,3,Eclectic way to pass an hour,"The museum is an eclectic mix of art, artifacts, textiles, furniture....there is a little bit of something for everyone. It's a great way to pass some time. However, it is insanely confusing to get around. The signage is horrible and all the galleries don't flow together so you can easily miss something.

I went at 11am on a Friday and it was full of school groups. I'm all for field trips, but it REALLY took away from the experience. Plan accordingly.

There is a replica house connected to it that is decorated in period furniture and wares. It was cool to walk through that.",Solo
2015/04,5,Lovely Little Museam - A Treat to have it in Providence,"While this museum is small, it has a lovely, large variety. The opened sarcophagus (look below and you can see the writing inside), the huge wood Budda, the room of period furniture, the newly-displayed fabric section and the nice variety of Impressionist paintings are just a few of the things to see. The special exhibits are also interesting - check them out on line or in the newspaper",Friends
2015/03,5,Well curated small art museum.,"I live in Rhode Island and make this a regular activity. Great programs for children, and generally a very fulfilling art museum experience. It is small, but very well curated. A sampling of everything from ancient Egypt to modern.

Be sure to check the website for the free admission times.

And inquire about the (free) RISD Nature Lab around the corner. A tiny but very cool place, too.",Family
2015/01,5,Nice place,Some cool things and the museum is larger than you might think and there is lots of variety ex.oecially with changing exhibits Sunday's are pay what you want so you can't beat that,couple

2015/04,5,Risd Museum Review,"This museum is amazing. On Sunday's, it is free for students. The museum features prominent international and American artists such as Picasso, Monet, Manet, Paul Revere and Andy Warhol. Perfect way to kill an hour or two. The attached store is an excellent place to pick up gifts for loved ones. Recommend to students, families & professionals. Children under 12 may have a limited attention span at such a facility.",couple
2015/04,5,Free Sunday afternoon activity,We visited on mother's day on Sunday afternoon. The admission was free and there was also a free piano concert in one of the second floor galleries. Very nice. There was also a kids activity where they could draw things which were later projected onto a wall and merged into a larger design. This is not a huge museum but there is a wonderful collection of early American silver and furniture as well as various periods of art represented. The area is also very nice with many 18th century buildings. This is an area you do not want to miss if you are visiting Providence.,Family
2015/05,4,An excellent art museum,"Well worth the detour, with pieces by well known artists as well as interesting pieces by lesser known or up-and-coming artists.",couple
2015/04,4,Great little museum that's not to be missed.,"Parking is never easy on college hill but the hassle is worth it to visit. Lots of historic pictures, artifacts and a house visit is available.",Friends
2015/04,4,Lovely small museum,I love this quirky museum. I especially like the rooms with the decorative arts and New England furniture. I also love their medieval and Renaissance rooms. Really worth a visit.,couple
2015/04,5,The RISD Museum Never Gets Boring,"I took Friends who were visiting the RISD Museum for the first time.
We entered on Benefit Street and started by going up the stairs to the contemporary changing exhibition and then through to the Egyptian art. There is a mummy. THen we went through the Chinese art which includes an elaborately painted sedan chair and some stunning textiles. The to the collection of Japanese wood block prints in a room designed by Phillip Johnson. That leads to a room with the largest wooden Buddah in the US, which leads to a room of Indian items. Turn left to get to a room of textile are filled with drawers that can be opened to reveal shoes and fans and gloves and articles of clothing. Wander through the old house filled with Colonial furnishings and paintings including a Gilbert Stuart George Washington. Exit the house into the hallway that leads to the great hall, floor to ceiling paintings. Sit in a red velvet chair and take time to look. And don't get me started. This is just the beginning.
The museum is free on Sundays and on gallery night the 3rd Thursday of the month.
If you are hungry, go out the Benefit Street entrance, turn left, cross over Waterman and Angell streets and on your right side, a block down, you will come to Den Den Asiana and Goeff's Superlative Sandwichs. Both good choices.",Friends
2015/04,4,Quite a variety,Never knew some of the most famous painters were so close. From Picasso to Renoir to Manet. I would highly recommend a visit.,
2015/04,5,What a gem!,I visited the RISD museum on a Sunday morning. There is free admission on Sundays. What an absolutely incredible museum this is. So much to see! There were many college students there with their classes sketching and discussing art. It was a great experience!,
2015/03,2,Welcome to the Home Depot Museum of Art,"We recently stopped by on a Sunday afternoon to hear pianist Ben Nacar play an original composition in the grand gallery at the RISD museum. The music was wonderful but there was little else to detain us. There was a time when we were members of what I once termed a ""small gem"" of a museum, when we would stroll through the several galleries savoring the incredible artwork but no longer.

Following the removal of 19th century American art from their two distinctive rooms along with the creation of a museum logo that not even the staff working at the front desk could explain we cancelled our membership.

I suppose it visitors eventually tired of those kitschy paintings by John Singer Sargent, William Merritt Chase, Frank Benson, Thomas Cole and Winslow Homer. So out they went, bending to the will of the lumber industry and now we find hanging prominently large pieces of wood painted green or maybe a nice bit of canvas painted, well, maybe with hardly anything at all.

I'm surprised the impressionists haven't been removed to make room for plastic bottles hanging from the ceiling.

But hey, before you run out to Home Depot to stock up on Benjamin Moore and sheets of plywood, you better check and make sure someone hasn't already sold a bill of goods to the best and brightest of art curators. . .",Couple 
2015/04,5,You need a whole day,"This museum is full of great stuff! drawers of antique textiles, Egyptian artifacts, Golden Age, Pottery, Matisse painting, many more!",Family
2015/04,5,A must see in Providence,"This museum is a great small art museum, which covers all periods and styles. We went here before touring RISD with our prospective student. The museum is free if you are taking a RISD admissions tour. It covers all the main art periods and many in between. I would love to be a student at RISD and go there regularly.",Family
2015/03,3,Eclectic mix of art and design,We loved the furniture that was exhibited. We found the layout of the museum to be a bit confusing and it wasn't always clear what the theme was to a particular room.,couple
2015/03,5,Worth the trip!!!,"I completely underestimated the beauty of this place. It had an amazing collection of great artists such as Picasso, Monet, Renoir, and Van Gogh, as well as artifacts from 16th century churches and ancient Greece. Do not miss this place if you're ever in Rhode Island. P.S. The grand gallery was a dream!",Solo
2015/03,F,Nice way to spend a rainy day,"The RISD has a wonderful collection of American, Egyptian, & European art. I liked the way they mixed everything together on every floor of the museum. Some GREAT pieces!",Friends
2015/03,5,Excellent,"A very interesting museum with a fascinating collection. My favourite the French Impressionists, a whole room full of wonderful paintings a not to be missed experience.",
2015/03,5,A must do...,"We lucked out by going on a Sunday where admission was free. This is one of the most eclectic museums I have been to (in the US), with the likes of Degas, Jackson Pollock, Roy Lichtenstein, Renoir, Monet, etc. were there for us to enjoy and admire. Sculpture, paintings, furnishings, textiles, modern, traditional, its all there, and many floors of it. Such a treasure and a pleasure in every way. You've absolutely go to go here next time you visit this charming city.",
2015/03,4,varied Museum….,The Museum is a series of twists and turns with the new folding in to the old. The layout of the Museum is a bit strange but they have really interesting exhibits and a pretty good permanent collection. Went on a rainy day and it was perfect to spend an hour and bit.,
2015/02,4,"A small, but wide-ranging collection","This isn't a full-day thing to do, probably a couple of hours or so for most people, perhaps as an add-on to a Brown University/East Side visit. The collection art and objects is small (as compared to larger, metropolitan museums) but it's eclectic and interesting. Being smaller, this museum is refreshingly intimate and not overwhelming as some can be given their vastness and crowds.
My favorite were the few rooms with paintings by Monet, Manet, Cezanne, Degas, Gaugin, Matisse, Vermeer, Van Gogh and other masters - simply breathtaking, stellar works of art.
Don't count on getting a spot in the parking lot that is listed on the museum's site as offering a discount; it seems it is usually full by early morning. You will probably have to drive around looking for another lot because the only other alternative is metered street parking.
Also, bring your own stroller, as the ones offered by the museum are only suitable for the tiniest of children or perhaps their dolls.
Finally, call ahead if you want to be sure a particular exhibit is open. We specifically wanted to see the Pendleton House, only to find out upon arrival it wasn't open because of either lack of staff or ongoing repairs (we were given both reasons by different people).
Museums should not charge full admission when a significant exhibit or large section is closed; thus the ""very good"" rating.part of the museum",Family
2015/03,4,Great small museum with an eclectic mix,"An interesting mix, from ancient art to re-assembled New England interiors, with a dash of 20th century design including 1930s dresses and 1960s furniture. A joy to see small but good representations of many different eras - accessible, varied and fun. And free on Sundays!",
2015/02,5,A maze of wonderment!,"This museum has so much to offer for all interests! There is everything ancient Egyptian art to super modern art, and literally everything in between. The rooms housing the art are designed so perfectly for each subject area and the small rooms and extensive connected hallways make the experience feel very intimate (even though there is SO MUCH to see). As a non-artsy person (I have no training in or educational background in art), I very much appreciated the small educational descriptions in each room that helped give context to what I was looking at. Some of my favorite things were the Estruscan jewelry, the Egyptian mummy (!), the textiles, and the Japanese art. I spent 3 hours in this museum by myself and could have spent another 3 hours had my feet not gotten tired. Can't wait to go back!",
2015/03,5,Impressive collection.,"Had been wanting to go for years, and in July 2014, I finally did. I thought the collection was interesting. The art included descriptions of what it was about/why I should be impressed, which some people would probably take offense at, but I appreciated it!",couple
2015/02,4,Art Downtown PVD,Small art museum downtown Providence. The selection of art through the ages is well worth seeing. And the art of the students and faculty is interesting.,couple
2015/02,5,Museum trip,We have a wonderful trip to RISD Museum of Art! I was impressed with the collections and size of the museum.,couple
2015/02,4,Larger than it looks,"I thought the RISD Art Museum would house art created by its students, but in fact, it has a collection of art that ranges from ancient to modern day. The museum is inexpensive - with discounts for students - and it's a nice addition to a Providence visit.",Family
2015/01,5,A visual treasure of outstanding art and artifacts.,"Wander the galleries and treat yourself to outstanding collections that range from Old Masters to vintage fashion to ancient artifacts and an incredible new textile exhibit. The RISD Museum is truly a gem, so allow plenty of time to check out amazing furniture, ancient relics, spectacular porcelain and silver, and works by contemporary artists and artisans. We are so lucky to have this museum in the heart of the city. Check their website for current exhibits and bring your family and Friends!",
2015/01,5,One of the best art museums I've been to!,"Really fascinating pieces of art as well as history and culture from around the globe. Would definitely recommend a visit by individuals, families or groups - a really interesting couple of hours (especially when the snow is heaping up outside!)",Friends
2015/02,5,GREAT Design Museum,"I'm a local and a member and go all the time to various events - note that lots of it is free one Thursday evening/month during ""Gallery Night"" - but it's worth the price of admission for anyone interested in design and the visual arts. Lovely museum, varied collection VERY well curated, not so big as to be overwhelming, but a broad-ranging and firstrate collection - also a very nice shop specializing in works by RISD graduates, from goofy cheap housewares to expensive one-offs (membership gets one a good discount - and this is my go-to place for things like wedding and housewarming gifts) and excellent special programs.

Again, I go all the time/know the place well.",Solo
2015/01,4,It's more than an Art School!,"I had not been back to the Providence area for quite some time. Little did I know that the museum here houses Picasso, Manet, Monet, etc. I was so impressed with their collection. If you're in the area and have some time, stop by and stroll through the many rooms of diverse art in house.",Business
2015/01,5,The Best in Providence and Getting Better All The Time,"Two of us are RISD alum from the 60's, so we have been here before. The changes, expansion, and improvements are impressive! The Asian department is exciting and greatly improved. The accent on fashion and fabric design is exciting and very well integrated. It takes a few minutes to figure out how the different buildings work together, but moving from gallery to gallery is easy and very enjoyable. This is not just lots of paintings hanging on white walls. The variety of the presentations is excellent. The museum store is well stocked with lots of interesting wearable art and crafts by RISD alum, and a small but adequate selection of refreshments. Three and a half hours was just enough for the four of us, but we all want to return again. This museum is as good as the finest regional museums in the country, and the best cultural venue in Providence.",couple
